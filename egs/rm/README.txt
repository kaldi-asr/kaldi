About the Resource Management corpus:
    Clean speech in a medium-vocabulary task consisting
    of commands to a (presumably imaginary) computer system.  About 3 hours
    of training data. 
    Available from the LDC as catalog number LDC93S3A (it may be possible to
    get the same data using combinations of other catalog numbers, but this
    is the one we used).


Each subdirectory of this directory contains the
scripts for a sequence of experiments. 
s5 is the currently recommmended setup.

  s4: A recipe based on freely available subset of RM data, distributed by CMU

  s5: This is the "new-new-style" recipe.  It is now finished.
      All further work will be on top of this style of recipe.  Note: 
      unlike previous recipes, this now uses the same underlying
      scripts as the WSJ recipe.
