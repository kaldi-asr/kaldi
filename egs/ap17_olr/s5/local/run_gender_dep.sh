# This script is not really finished, all it does is train a model with its
# means adapted to the female data, to demonstrate MAP adaptation.  To have real
# gender dependent decoding (which anyway we're not very enthused about), we
# would have to train both models, do some kind of gender identification, and
# then decode.  Or we could use the gender information in the test set.  But
# anyway that's not a direction we really want to go right now.
