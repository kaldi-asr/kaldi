# It uses a couple of strategies to fill-in words in
# the LM training data but not in CMUdict.  One is
# to generate special prons for possible acronyms, that
# just consist of the constituent letters.  The other
# is designed to handle derivatives of known words
# (e.g. deriving the pron of a plural from the pron of
# the base-word), but in a more general, learned-from-data
# way.
# It makes use of scripts in local/dict/
