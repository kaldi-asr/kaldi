# this is called from the other nnet and chain training scripts.
# It prepares normal-resolution MFCC features for purposes of getting
# alignments and/or lattices on the speed-perturbed data.
# These will either be from the IHM data (with the --use-ihm-ali true option),
# or with the target data as given by the --mic option.
#
# please see local/nnet3/run_tdnn.sh and local/chain/run_tdnn.sh for examples of
# usage.
