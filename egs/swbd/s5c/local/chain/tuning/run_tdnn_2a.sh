# _2a is as _z but setting --lm-opts "--num-extra-states=8000".
#  Note, this leads to a cutoff of zero, so it's the same as infinite --num-extra-states.
#  The table below compares a sequence of experiments {x,s,w,z,2a} where only
#  the --num-extra-states is varied.

#    I'm also adding to this table some other experiments: 2d, which also had
#   --num-extra-states=2000 --ngram-order=4 --leftmost-context-questions=/dev/null [so
#     there was no concept of sets of phones for the 3-gram, plus we could go to 4-gram].
#    [note that the actual baseline for 2d was 2c, which was as 2a but with
#      a code change RE transition-scale, but that made no consistent difference, so
#      acting as if that was a no-op.]
#
#
#  Comparing the --num-extra-states:
#
#  --num-extra-states:   0       200     500    2000    8000         *these all had the default --leftmost-context-questions, splitting to ~23 sets.]
#  --num-extra-states:                                         2000   *plus: --ngram-order=4 --leftmost-context-questions=/dev/null [so 3gram and 4gram all in one set, and 4gram allowed.]
# new code, --num-lm-states,--ngram-order:                             10k,5  7k,5   5k,4  (this pruned on state count and only left bigrams unpruned)
# newer code, --num-extra-lm-states (note, ngram-order=5,no-prune-order=3)                    2000    1000   (prune on perplexity, no-prune default=3gram).

# _z is as _x but setting  --lm-opts "--num-extra-states=2000".
# (see also y, which has --num-extra-states=500).

# _x is as _s but setting  --lm-opts "--num-extra-states=0".
#  this is a kind of repeat of the u->v experiment, where it seemed to make things
#  worse, but there were other factors involved in that so I want to be sure.

# _s is as _q but setting pdf-boundary-penalty to 0.0
# This is helpful: 19.8->18.0 after fg rescoring on all of eval2000,
# and 18.07 -> 16.96 on train_dev, after fg rescoring.

# _q is as _p except making the same change as from n->o, which
# reduces the parameters to try to reduce over-training.  We reduce
# relu-dim from 1024 to 850, and target num-states from 12k to 9k,
# and modify the splicing setup.
# note: I don't rerun the tree-building, I just use the '5o' treedir.

# _p is as _m except with a code change in which we switch to a different, more
# exact mechanism to deal with the edges of the egs, and correspondingly
# different script options... we now dump weights with the egs, and apply the
# weights to the derivative w.r.t. the output instead of using the
# --min-deriv-time and --max-deriv-time options.  Increased the frames-overlap
# to 30 also.  This wil.  give 10 frames on each side with zero derivs, then
# ramping up to a weight of 1.0 over 10 frames.

# _m is as _k but after a code change that makes the denominator FST more
# compact.  I am rerunning in order to verify that the WER is not changed (since
# it's possible in principle that due to edge effects related to weight-pushing,
# the results could be a bit different).
#  The results are inconsistently different but broadly the same.  On all of eval2000,
#  the change k->m is 20.7->20.9 with tg LM and 18.9->18.6 after rescoring.
#  On the train_dev data, the change is  19.3->18.9 with tg LM and 17.6->17.6 after rescoring.


# _k is as _i but reverting the g->h change, removing the --scale-max-param-change
# option and setting max-param-change to 1..  Using the same egs.

# _i is as _h but longer egs: 150 frames instead of 75, and
# 128 elements per minibatch instead of 256.

# _h is as _g but different application of max-param-change (use --scale-max-param-change true)

# _g is as _f but more splicing at last layer.

# _f is as _e but with 30 as the number of left phone classes instead
# of 10.

# _e is as _d but making it more similar in configuration to _b.
# (turns out b was better than a after all-- the egs' likelihoods had to
# be corrected before comparing them).
# the changes (vs. d) are: change num-pdfs target from 8k to 12k,
# multiply learning rates by 5, and set final-layer-normalize-target to 0.5.

# _d is as _c but with a modified topology (with 4 distinct states per phone
# instead of 2), and a slightly larger num-states (8000) to compensate for the
# different topology, which has more states.

# _c is as _a but getting rid of the final-layer-normalize-target (making it 1.0
# as the default) as it's not clear that it was helpful; using the old learning-rates;
# and modifying the target-num-states to 7000.

# _b is as as _a except for configuration changes: using 12k num-leaves instead of
# 5k; using 5 times larger learning rate, and --final-layer-normalize-target=0.5,
# which will make the final layer learn less fast compared with other layers.
