Recipe for the African Accented Speech Corpus

This recipe follows the pattern of the mini_librispeech recipe.
It is built using the African Accented French Corpus available from the Open Speech and Language Resources repository.

Information about the corpus is at:

http://www.openslr.org/57

This recipe uses about 11 hours of speech from the corpus for training, about 1.5 hours for development and about 20 minutes for testing.
Most of the speakers are from Cameroon. 
However, there are recordings from speakers from   Chad, Congo, and Gabon. 

All of the data resources required to run this recipe are freely available on the web.
In addition to the speech data, the cmusphinx French lexicon is used for a pronouncing dictionary and the French open subtitles text corpus  is used to build language models.
