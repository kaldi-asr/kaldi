       select-vocab - Select a maximum-likelihood vocabulary from a mixture of
       corpora.

       sseelleecctt--vvooccaabb picks a vocabulary from the union of the  vocabularies  of
       files  _f_1 through _f_n in order to maximize the likelihood of the heldout
       file.  When invoked as above, the program will print out (unsorted) the
       list  of words in all of the input corpora together with their weights.
       This list may subsequently be sorted to put  the  words  in  decreasing
       order  of  weight  and a vocabulary may be chosen by picking a suitable
       threshold weight and ignoring words with weight less than this.

       A number of automatically detected formats are supported for the  input
       files  _f_1 through _f_n_.  They can be count files, which are characterized
       by each line ending in a number, ARPA  language  models  in  nnggrraamm--ffoorr--
       mmaatt(5),  or  simply  text  files.  If they are text-files, further, and
       their names end in ".sentid", it is assumed that  the  first  field  of
       each  line  is  a sentence identifier that is then discarded.  Further-
       more, all of the input  files  can  also  be  compressed  (if  gzip  is
       installed and available on the system).

       --hheellpp  Prints a short help message.

       --hheellddoouutt _f_i_l_e
              Likelihood  maximization  is  performed on the contents of _f_i_l_e_.
              This file may also be in any of the formats  supported  for  the
              input corpora, namely: text, counts, sentid, or ARPA-lm.

       --qquuiieett Suppresses  printing  of progress and other informative messages
              during execution.  By default the script writes these out to the
              output error stream.

       --ssccaallee _n
              The  combined  final counts are scaled by _n before being written
              out. This makes it possible to sort the output list  numerically
              with sort(1).  The default scale is 1e6.

       This  implementation corrects a minor error in the algorithm specifica-
       tion in [1].  The paper describes corpus level interpolation,  but  the
       script actually does word-level interpolation.

       The  program  is  written in perl(1) and requires it to be installed in
       order to run.
