       sseeggmmeenntt  infers  a most likely segmentation (location of segment bound-
       aries) from a text, based on a segment language  model.   The  language
       model  is a standard backoff N-gram model in ARPA nnggrraamm--ffoorrmmaatt(5), mod-
       eling segmentation using the boundary tags <s> and </s>.   The  program
       reads  in  a  word sequence, finds the most likely locations of segment
       boundaries according to  the  language  model,  and  outputs  the  word
       sequence with segment boundaries marked by <s> tags.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a compressed file (name
       ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --oorrddeerr _n
              Set the maximal N-gram order to be used, by  default  3.   NOTE:
              The  order  of  the  model is not set automatically when a model
              file is read, so the same file can be used at various orders.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Set the debugging output level (0 means  no  debugging  output).
              Debugging messages are sent to stderr.

       --llmm _f_i_l_e
              Read the N-gram model from _f_i_l_e.

       --tteexxtt _f_i_l_e
              Find the text to be segmented in _f_i_l_e.  Default input is stdin.

       --ccoonnttiinnuuoouuss
              Process  all  words in the input as one sequence of words, irre-
              spective of line breaks.  Normally each line is processed  sepa-
              rately as a word sequence.

       --ppoosstteerriioorrss
              Use a forward-backward algorithm to compute the posterior proba-
              bilities of a segment boundary  at  each  word  transition,  and
              hypothesize a boundary whenever the probability exceeds 0.5.  By
              default a Viterbi algorithm is used that computes  the  globally
              most likely segmentation.
              If  --ccoonnttiinnuuoouuss is specified as well, then this option will pro-
              duce one line of output per word, containing, respectively,  the
              <s>  tag  (if  appropriate),  the word itself, and the posterior
              probability for a boundary preceding the word.

       --uunnkk   Output the unknown word token <unk> for each input word  not  in
              the  language  model  vocabulary.   The default is to output the
              input word unchanged.

       --ssttaagg _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Use _s_t_r_i_n_g to mark segment boundaries in the output.  Default is
              the  start-of-sentence  symbol  defined  in  the  language model
              (<s>).

       --bbiiaass _b
              Make a segment boundary a priori more likely by a factor  of  _b.
              This  allows balancing of false detection/rejection errors.  The
              default is 1.
