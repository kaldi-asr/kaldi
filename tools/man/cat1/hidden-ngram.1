DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       hhiiddddeenn--nnggrraamm  tags a stream of word tokens with hidden events occurring
       between words.  For example, an unsegmented text could  be  tagged  for
       sentence  boundaries  (the  hidden events in this case being `boundary'
       and `no-boundary').  The most likely  hidden  tag  sequence  consistent
       with  the  given word sequence is found according to an N-gram language
       model over both words and hidden tags.

       hhiiddddeenn--nnggrraamm is a generalization of sseeggmmeenntt(1).

       Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a compressed file (name
       ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --tteexxtt _f_i_l_e
              Specifies  the  file  containing the word sequences to be tagged
              (one sentence per line).  Start- and  end-of-sentence  tags  are
              _n_o_t added by the program, but should be included in the input if
              the language model uses them.

       --eessccaappee _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Set an ``escape string.''  Input lines starting with _s_t_r_i_n_g  are
              not  processed  and  passed  unchanged  to stdout instead.  This
              allows associated information to be passed  to  scoring  scripts
              etc.

       --tteexxtt--mmaapp _f_i_l_e
              Read  the input words from a map file contain both the words and
              additional likelihoods of events following each word.  Each line
              contains  one  input word, plus optional hidden-event/likelihood
              pairs in the format
                   _w    _e_1 [_p_1] _e_2 [_p_2] ...
              If a _p value is omitted a  likelihood  of  1  is  assumed.   All
              events  not  explicitly  listed  are given likelihood 0, and are
              hence  excluded  for  that  word.   In  particular,  the   label
              **nnooeevveenntt**  must  be  listed  to allow absence of a hidden event.
              Input  word  strings  are  assembled  from  multiple  lines   of
              --tteexxtt--mmaapp  input  until  either an end-of-sentence token </s> is
              found, or an escaped line (see --eessccaappee) is encountered.

       --llooggmmaapp
              Interpret numeric values in the --tteexxtt--mmaapp file as log probabili-
              ties, rather than probabilities.

       --llmm _f_i_l_e
              Specifies  the word/tag language model as a standard ARPA N-gram
              backoff model file in nnggrraamm--ffoorrmmaatt(5).

       --uussee--sseerrvveerr _S
              Use a network LM server (typically implemented by nnggrraamm(1)  with
              the --sseerrvveerr--ppoorrtt option) as the main model.  The server specifi-
              cation _S can be an unsigned integer port number (referring to  a
              server port running on the local host), a hostname (referring to
              default port 2525 on the named host), or a string  of  the  form
              _p_o_r_t@_h_o_s_t, where _p_o_r_t is a portnumber and _h_o_s_t is either a host-
              name ("dukas.speech.sri.com") or IP number in dotted-quad format
              ("140.44.1.15").
              For  server-based  LMs,  the  --oorrddeerr  option  limits the context
              length of N-grams queried by the client (with 0 denoting  unlim-
              ited  length).   Hence, the effective LM order is the mimimum of
              the client-specified value and  any  limit  implemented  in  the
              server.
              When  --uussee--sseerrvveerr  is  specified,  the  arguments to the options
              --mmiixx--llmm, --mmiixx--llmm22, etc.  are  also  interpreted  as  network  LM
              server  specifications provided they contain a '@' character and
              do not contain a '/' character.  This  allows  the  creation  of
              mixtures of several file- and/or network-based LMs.

       --ccaacchhee--sseerrvveedd--nnggrraammss
              Enables  client-side  caching  of N-gram probabilities to elimi-
              nated duplicate  network  queries,  in  conjunction  with  --uussee--
              sseerrvveerr.   This can results in a substantial speedup but requires
              memory in the client that may grow linearly with the  amount  of
              data processed.

       --oorrddeerr _n
              Set  the effective N-gram order used by the language model to _n.
              Default is 3 (use a trigram model).

       --ccllaasssseess _f_i_l_e
              Interpret the LM as an N-gram over word classes.  The expansions
              of  the  classes are given in _f_i_l_e in ccllaasssseess--ffoorrmmaatt(5).  Tokens
              in the LM that are not defined as classes in _f_i_l_e are assumed to
              be  plain  words,  so that the LM can contain mixed N-grams over
              both words and word classes.

       --ssiimmppllee--ccllaasssseess
              Assume a "simple" class model: each word is member  of  at  most
              one word class, and class expansions are exactly one word long.

       --mmiixx--llmm _f_i_l_e
              Read a second N-gram model for interpolation purposes.  The sec-
              ond and any additional interpolated models can also be class  N-
              grams (using the same --ccllaasssseess definitions).

       --ffaaccttoorreedd
              Interpret  the files specified by --llmm, --mmiixx--llmm, etc. as factored
              N-gram model specifications.  See nnggrraamm(1) for more details.

       --llaammbbddaa _w_e_i_g_h_t
              Set the weight of the main model when interpolating  with  --mmiixx--
              llmm.  Default value is 0.5.

       --mmiixx--llmm22 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm33 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm44 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm55 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm66 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm77 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm88 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm99 _f_i_l_e
              Up to 9 more N-gram models can be specified for interpolation.

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa22 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa33 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa44 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa55 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa66 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa77 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa88 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa99 _w_e_i_g_h_t
              These  are  the  weights  for the additional mixture components,
              corresponding to --mmiixx--llmm22 through --mmiixx--llmm99.  The weight for  the
              --mmiixx--llmm  model  is  1  minus the sum of --llaammbbddaa and --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa22
              through --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa99.

       --ccoonntteexxtt--pprriioorrss _f_i_l_e
              Read context-dependent mixture weight priors  from  _f_i_l_e.   Each
              line  in  _f_i_l_e should contain a context N-gram (most recent word
              first) followed by a vector  of  mixture  weights  whose  length
              matches the number of LMs being interpolated.

       --bbaayyeess _l_e_n_g_t_h
              Interpolate  models  using  posterior probabilities based on the
              likelihoods of local N-gram  contexts  of  length  _l_e_n_g_t_h.   The
              --llaammbbddaa  values  are used as prior mixture weights in this case.
              This option can also be combined with --ccoonntteexxtt--pprriioorrss, in  which
              case  the  _l_e_n_g_t_h parameter also controls how many words of con-
              text are maximally used to look up mixture  weights.   If  --ccoonn--
              tteexxtt--pprriioorrss  is  used without --bbaayyeess, the context length used is
              set by the --oorrddeerr option and Bayesian interpolation is disabled,
              as when _s_c_a_l_e (see next) is zero.

       --bbaayyeess--ssccaallee _s_c_a_l_e
              Set  the  exponential  scale factor on the context likelihood in
              conjunction with the --bbaayyeess function.  Default value is 1.0.

       --llmmww _W Scales the language model probabilities by a factor _W.   Default
              language model weight is 1.

       --mmaappww _W
              Scales  the  likelihood  map probability by a factor _W.  Default
              map weight is 1.

       --ttoolloowweerr
              Map vocabulary to lowercase, removing case distinctions.

       --vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Initialize the vocabulary for the LM from _f_i_l_e.  This is  useful
              in conjunction with --lliimmiitt--vvooccaabb.

       --vvooccaabb--aalliiaasseess _f_i_l_e
              Reads  vocabulary  alias  definitions  from  _f_i_l_e, consisting of
              lines of the form
                   _a_l_i_a_s _w_o_r_d
              This causes all tokens _a_l_i_a_s to be mapped to _w_o_r_d.

       --hhiiddddeenn--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read the list of hidden tags from _f_i_l_e.  Note: This is a  subset
              of the vocabulary contained in the language model.

       --lliimmiitt--vvooccaabb
              Discard  LM  parameters  on  reading  that do not pertain to the
              words specified in the vocabulary, either by --vvooccaabb or  --hhiiddddeenn--
              vvooccaabb.   The  default is that words used in the LM are automati-
              cally added to the vocabulary.   This  option  can  be  used  to
              reduce  the  memory requirements for large LMs that are going to
              be evaluated only on a small vocabulary subset.

       --ffoorrccee--eevveenntt
              Forces a non-default event after every word.  This is useful for
              language models that represent the default event explicitly with
              a tag, rather than implicitly by the absence of  a  tag  between
              words (which is the default).

       --kkeeeepp--uunnkk
              Do  not  map  unknown  input words to the <unk> token.  Instead,
              output the input word unchanged.  Also, with this option the  LM
              is  assumed  to be open-vocabulary (the default is close-vocabu-
              lary).

       --ffbb    Perform forward-backward decoding of the input  token  sequence.
              Outputs  the  tags  that have the highest posterior probability,
              for each position.  The default  is  to  use  Viterbi  decoding,
              i.e., the output is the tag sequence with the highest joint pos-
              terior probability.

       --ffww--oonnllyy
              Similar to --ffbb, but uses only the forward probabilities for com-
              puting posteriors.  This may be used to simulate on-line predic-
              tion of tags, without the benefit of future context.

       --ccoonnttiinnuuoouuss
              Process all words in the input as one sequence of  words,  irre-
              spective  of line breaks.  Normally each line is processed sepa-
              rately as a sentence.  Input  tokens  are  output  one-per-line,
              followed by event tokens.

       --ppoosstteerriioorrss
              Output  the  table of posterior probabilities for each tag posi-
              tion.  If --ffbb is also specified the posterior probabilities will
              be  computed  using forward-backward probabilities; otherwise an
              approximation will be used that is based on the  probability  of
              the most likely path containing a given tag at given position.

       --ttoottaallss
              Output the total string probability for each input sentence.  If
              --ffbb is also specified this probability is  obtained  by  summing
              over  all  hidden  event  sequences;  otherwise it is calculated
              (i.e., underestimated) using  the  most  probably  hidden  event
              sequence.

       --nnbbeesstt _N
              Output the _N best hypotheses instead of just the first best when
              doing Viterbi search.  If _N>1, then each hypothesis is  prefixed
              by  the  tag NNBBEESSTT___n _x,, where _n is the rank of the hypothesis in
              the N-best list and _x its score, the negative log  of  the  com-
              bined  probability of transitions and observations of the corre-
              sponding HMM path.

       --wwrriittee--ccoouunnttss _f_i_l_e
              Write the posterior weighted counts of n-grams, including  those
              with  hidden  tags,  summed over the entire input data, to _f_i_l_e.
              The posterior probabilities should normally be computed with the
              forward-backward  algorithm  (instead  of  Viterbi),  so the --ffbb
              option is usually also specified.  Only n-grams  whose  contexts
              occur in the language model are output.

       --uunnkk--pprroobb _L
              Specifies  that unknown words and other words having zero proba-
              bility in the language model be assigned a log probability of _L.
              This  is -100 by default but might be set to 0, e.g., to compute
              perplexities excluding unknown words.

       --ddeebbuugg Sets debugging output level.

       Each filename argument can be an  ASCII  file,  or  a  compressed  file
       (name  ending  in  .Z  or  .gz),  or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

BBUUGGSS
       The  --ccoonnttiinnuuoouuss  and  --tteexxtt--mmaapp options effectively disable --kkeeeepp--uunnkk,
       i.e., unknown input words are always mapped to <unk>.  Also,  --ccoonnttiinnuu--
       oouuss  doesn't  preserve the positions of escaped input lines relative to
       the input.
       The dynamic programming for event decoding is  not  efficiently  inter-
       leaved  with  that required to evaluate class N-gram models; therefore,
       the state space generated in decoding  with  --ccllaasssseess  quickly  becomes
       infeasibly large unless --ssiimmppllee--ccllaasssseess is also specified.
