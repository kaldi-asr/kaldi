       nbest-lattice - rescore N-best lists and lattices

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee [ --hheellpp ] _o_p_t_i_o_n ...

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee rescores N-best lists or optimizes word-level recognition
       scores (as opposed to sentence-level scores).  There are two  rescoring
       modes.   In  _N_-_b_e_s_t  _w_o_r_d _e_r_r_o_r _m_i_n_i_m_i_z_a_t_i_o_n mode, the program computes
       the posterior expected word error for each hypothesis relative  to  all
       hypotheses in the N-best list, choosing the one with the lowest value.

       In  _l_a_t_t_i_c_e _w_o_r_d _e_r_r_o_r _m_i_n_i_m_i_z_a_t_i_o_n mode, the program constructs a word
       lattice from all the N-best hypotheses and extracts the path  with  the
       lowest expected word error.  This is similar to N-best word error mini-
       mization but allows hypotheses not contained in  the  N-best  list.   A
       variant of this mode uses a word ``mesh'' instead of a word lattice, in
       which all hypotheses are aligned into a grid of word positions, and one
       is  allowed  to  chose a word from each grid position, thus allowing an
       even greater number of potential hypotheses.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a compressed file (name
       ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Controls  the amount of output (the higher the _l_e_v_e_l, the more).
              At level 1, the  expected  word  error  counts  for  the  chosen
              hypotheses  are  printed.  At level 2, the word posterior proba-
              bilities are printed in addition (only for lattice mode, similar
              to --dduummpp--ppoosstteerriioorrss).

       --wweerr   Chooses N-best word error minimization mode.

       --llaattttiiccee--wweerr
              Chooses lattice word error minimization mode (the default).

       --uussee--mmeesshh
              Choose the variant of lattice mode that uses word meshes instead
              of simple lattices.

       --ddeelleettiioonn--bbiiaass _D
              Causes the probabilities of deletions to be biased by a factor _D
              in  doing mesh-based word error minimization.  This controls the
              trade-off between insertion and deletion errors.  The default is
              1 (no bias).

       --rreessccoorree _f_i_l_e
              Reads  the N-best list from _f_i_l_e.  The N-best list can be in any
              of the formats described in nnbbeesstt--ffoorrmmaatt(5).

       --nnbbeesstt _f_i_l_e
              A synonym for --rreessccoorree.

       --wwrriittee--nnbbeesstt _f_i_l_e
              Outputs the N-best list to a file, after sorting and  processing
              (for validation or format conversion purposes).

       --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess _f_i_l_e_-_l_i_s_t
              Rescores  multiple  N-best  lists  whose filenames are read from
              _f_i_l_e_-_l_i_s_t.

       --wwrriittee--nnbbeesstt--ddiirr _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Outputs N-best lists to _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y,  to  files  named  after  the
              input N-best lists, for when multiple N-best lists are processed
              (see --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess).

       --wwrriittee--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Outputs vocabulary used in N-best list.

       --ddeecciipphheerr--nnbbeesstt
              Output N-best list in Decipher nnbbeesstt--ffoorrmmaatt(5), rather than  the
              default  native  SRILM format.  (All N-best formats are accepted
              for input regardless of this option.)

       --nnoo--rreessccoorree
              Suppress rescoring of lattices; useful if only the operations of
              lattice/N-best list reading/writing are desired.

       --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt _n
              Limits  the  number  of hypotheses read from each N-best list to
              the first _n.

       --mmaaxx--rreessccoorree _m
              In N-best mode, only choose among  the  top  _m  hypotheses  when
              optimizing  word error.  This is convenient to limit computation
              for long N-best lists.  The cutoff is  made  after  reading  all
              hypotheses (subject to --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt) and reordering them according
              to the posterior probabilities.
              The worst-case time taken in N-best error minimization  is  pro-
              portional to _m times _n, where _n is the length of the N-best list
              (or the value given to --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt).  However,  in  practice  the
              average time per sentence is independent of _m, so this option is
              usually not necessary.
              In lattice mode, only align the top _m scoring hypotheses  (after
              reweighting and sorting) into the lattice.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--pprruunnee _t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d
              Don't process N-best hypotheses whose cumulative posterior prob-
              ability is below _t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d.  This is another strategy  to  speed
              up the algorithm.

       --nnoo--rreeoorrddeerr
              Process N-best hypotheses in the order in which they appear.  By
              default, hypotheses are first sorted by their aggregate scores.

       --nnbbeesstt--bbaacckkttrraaccee
              Preserve backtrace information (word-level timemarks and scores)
              when  reading  N-best  lists  containing  such  information (see
              nnbbeesstt--ffoorrmmaatt(5)).  The default is to ignore  backtrace  informa-
              tion  and record only sentence-level scores and the word identi-
              ties.

       --oouuttppuutt--ccttmm
              Output word hypotheses in NIST CTM (conversation time mark) for-
              mat.  Note that word start times will be relative to the segment
              start times, the first column will contain the N-best  filename,
              and  the  channel  field is always 1.  The word confidence field
              contains posterior  probabilities.   This  option  also  implies
              --nnbbeesstt--bbaacckkttrraaccee.

       --rreessccoorree--llmmww _l_m_w
              Sets  the  language  model weight used in combining the language
              model log probabilities with acoustic  log  probabilities  (only
              relevant if separate scores are given in the N-best input).

       --rreessccoorree--wwttww _w_t_w
              Sets  the  word  transition  weight used to weight the number of
              words relative to the acoustic log probabilities (only  relevant
              if separate scores are given in the N-best input).
              If --nnoo--rreeoorrddeerr is not specified, and either _l_m_w or _w_t_w are spec-
              ified to be non-zero, the aggregate scores are recomputed  using
              those  weights; otherwise aggregate scores supplied in the input
              N-best lists are used to sort hypotheses.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--ssccaallee _s_c_a_l_e
              Divide the total weighted log score by _s_c_a_l_e when computing nor-
              malized  posterior  probabilities.  This controls the peakedness
              of the posterior distribution.  The default  value  is  whatever
              was  chosen  for --rreessccoorree--llmmww, so that language model scores are
              scaled to have weight 1, and acoustic scores have weight 1/_l_m_w.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--aammww _a_m_w
              Sets the acoustic model weight  for  computing  posteriors;  the
              default is 1.  This and the next two options allow posteriors to
              be computed using a different weighting than that used in  rank-
              ing and reordering the hypotheses.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--llmmww _l_m_w
              Sets  the  language  model weight for computing posteriors.  The
              default is to use whatever was specified for --rreessccoorree--llmmww.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--wwttww _w_t_w
              Sets the word transition weight for computing  posteriors.   The
              default is to use whatever was specified for --rreessccoorree--wwttww.
              If all three of _a_m_w, _l_m_w, and _w_t_w are set to zero the posteriors
              are computed directly from the aggregate scores stored in the N-
              best input.

       --vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read  the  N-best  list  vocabulary  from  _f_i_l_e.  This option is
              mostly redundant since words  found  in  the  N-best  input  are
              implicitly added to the vocabulary.

       --vvooccaabb--aalliiaasseess _f_i_l_e
              Reads  vocabulary  alias  definitions  from  _f_i_l_e, consisting of
              lines of the form
                   _a_l_i_a_s _w_o_r_d
              This causes all tokens _a_l_i_a_s to be mapped to _w_o_r_d.

       --ttoolloowweerr
              Map vocabulary to lowercase, eliminating case distinctions.

       --mmuullttiiwwoorrddss
              Split multiwords (words joined by  '_')  into  their  components
              when reading N-best lists.

       --mmuullttii--cchhaarr _C
              Character  used  to  delimit  component  words in multiwords (an
              underscore character by default).

       --nnooiissee _n_o_i_s_e_-_t_a_g
              Designate _n_o_i_s_e_-_t_a_g as a vocabulary item that is to  be  ignored
              in  aligning  hypotheses  with each other (the same as the -pau-
              word).  This is typically used to identify a noise marker.

       --nnooiissee--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read several noise tags from _f_i_l_e, instead of,  or  in  addition
              to, the single noise tag specified by --nnooiissee.

       --kkeeeepp--nnooiissee
              Do not remove pause or noise tokens from hypotheses. The default
              is to preserve noise tags but still eliminate pauses.

       --nnbbeesstt--eerrrroorr
              Compute the N-best error (minimum word error) of the N-best list
              read  with  --nnbbeesstt.   Pause  and noise tokens (as specified with
              --nnooiissee) in the N-best list are ignored.

       --dduummpp--ppoosstteerriioorrss
              Output posterior probabilities of all N-best hypotheses  instead
              of  choosing the best hypothesis.  In N-best mode, only the pos-
              terior probability for each hypothesis is  output.   In  lattice
              mode, the hyp posterior is followed by word posterior probabili-
              ties for each (non-pause, non-noise) token  in  the  hypothesis.
              The  --mmaaxx--rreessccoorree  option limits the number of hypotheses per N-
              best list processed.

       --dduummpp--eerrrroorrss
              Output word correctness indicators  for  all  N-best  hypotheses
              instead of choosing the best hypothesis.  For each hypothesis, a
              line is output containing first the total number of  errors  and
              the list of indicators of whether the corresponding word is cor-
              rect, substituted or inserted relative to the reference  string.
              The location of deleted words is also indicated by a correspond-
              ing marker.   The  --mmaaxx--rreessccoorree  option  limits  the  number  of
              hypotheses per N-best list processed.

       --rreeffeerreennccee _w_1 _w_2 _._._.
              Specifies  a  reference  word  string  for --dduummpp--eerrrroorrss, --nnbbeesstt--
              eerrrroorr, and --llaattttiiccee--eerrrroorr options.  Additionally,  in  --uussee--mmeesshh
              mode,  the reference words are recorded in the word mesh and can
              be output with --wwrriittee, indicating which word in  each  alignment
              position is the correct one.

       --rreeffss _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s
              Read  a  table of reference transcripts from file _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e, for
              when multiple N-best lists  are  processed  (see  --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess).
              Each  line  in _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s must contain the sentence ID (the last
              component in the N-best filename path, minus any suffixes)  fol-
              lowed by zero or more reference words.

       The following options only affect lattice mode.

       --rreeaadd _f_i_l_e
              Reads an initial lattice from _f_i_l_e, to be merged with additional
              paths constructed from the N-best hypotheses.

       --llaattttiiccee--ffiilleess _f_i_l_e
              Reads the names of one or more lattices  from  _f_i_l_e  and  aligns
              those  lattices with the main lattice being built.  Each line of
              _f_i_l_e must contain a lattice filename, optionally followed  by  a
              weight.

       --wwrriittee _f_i_l_e
              Writes  the resulting word posterior lattice or mesh to _f_i_l_e, in
              wwllaatt--ffoorrmmaatt(5).

       --wwrriittee--ddiirr _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Write the resulting N-best lattices to _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, in files named
              after the input N-best lists, for when multiple N-best lists are
              processed (see --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess).

       --pprriimmee--llaattttiiccee
              Start building the lattice with  the  best  hypothesis  obtained
              from  N-best  error minimization.  This produces slightly better
              alignments and sometimes lower error rates.  The default  is  to
              start with the top-scoring hypothesis.

       --pprriimmee--wwiitthh--11bbeesstt
              Similar  to  --pprriimmee--llaattttiiccee,  but  uses  the top-ranked sentence
              hypothesis for  priming.   (Experience  shows  that  --nnoo--rreeoorrddeerr
              --pprriimmee--llaattttiiccee gives best results.)

       --pprriimmee--wwiitthh--rreeffss
              Similar  to  --pprriimmee--llaattttiiccee,  but  uses  the reference words for
              priming.

       --nnoo--mmeerrggee
              Build a lattice from the N-best hypotheses without merging edges
              (string/lattice  alignment).   This  creates  a lattice with one
              disjoint path per hypothesis, and is useful mainly for debugging
              purposes.   This  option has no effect with --uussee--mmeesshh since word
              meshes can represent only one word type per alignment position.

       --llaattttiiccee--eerrrroorr
              Compute the lattice error (minimum word error)  of  the  lattice
              read with --rreeaadd or built with --nnbbeesstt.

       --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy file
              Use  word pronunciations listed in _f_i_l_e to construct word align-
              ments when building word meshes.  This  will  use  an  alignment
              cost  function that reflects the number of inserted/deleted/sub-
              stituted phones, rather than words.  The dictionary _f_i_l_e  should
              contain  one  pronunciation  per line, each naming a word in the
              first field, followed by a string of phone symbols.

       --hhiiddddeenn--vvooccaabb file
              Read a subvocabulary from _f_i_l_e and constrain word meshes to only
              align  those  words that are either all in or outside the subvo-
              cabulary.  This may be used to keep ``hidden event''  tags  from
              aligning with regular words.

       --rreeccoorrdd--hhyyppss
              Record  the ranks of the hyps contributing to each word hypothe-
              sis in the resulting word lattice; the information  is  included
              in --wwrriittee output.

BBUUGGSS
       Several functions are not uniformly implemented for all rescoring modes
       (e.g.,  --llaattttiiccee--ffiilleess, --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy, --rreeccoorrdd--hhyyppss, and --nnbbeesstt--bbaacckkttrraaccee
       are currently effective only in mesh-lattice mode).
       It is a common mistake (not a bug) to use the default LM weight with N-
       best lists directly from Decipher.  Decipher N-best lists have the rec-
       ognizer's LM weight already built in, so they should be processed with
            nbest-lattice -rescore-lmw 1 -posterior-scale _L_M_W
       where _L_M_W is the LM weight during recognition.  This is not an issue if
       the N-best lists have been rescored with rreessccoorree--ddeecciipphheerr.
