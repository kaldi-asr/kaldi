       aannttii--nnggrraamm counts the N-grams in a set of N-best hypotheses lists.  The
       N-gram counts are  weighted  by  the  posterior  probabilities  of  the
       hypotheses  they  occur  in.  Thus, aannttii--nnggrraamm can be used to construct
       language models of word sequences that are acoustically confusable with
       correct  hypotheses.  The counts output should be processed with nnggrraamm--
       ccoouunntt --ffllooaatt--ccoouunnttss to estimate a language model.

       Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a compressed file (name
       ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --rreeffss _f_i_l_e
              Read the reference transcripts from _f_i_l_e.  Each line should con-
              tain an utterance ID followed by the transcript words.

       --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess _f_i_l_e
              List of N-best files.  The base  components  of  filenames  must
              correspond to the utterance IDs found in the reference file.

       --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt _n
              Limits  the  number  of hypotheses read from each N-best list to
              the first _n.

       --oorrddeerr _n
              Set the maximal order (length) of N-grams to count.  The default
              order is 3.

       --llmm _f_i_l_e
              Reads  an  ARPA language model from _f_i_l_e and rescores the N-best
              lists with it prior to counting N-grams.

       --ccllaasssseess _f_i_l_e
              Interpret the LM as a class-based N-gram and read class  defini-
              tions in ccllaasssseess--ffoorrmmaatt(5) from _f_i_l_e.

       --ttoolloowweerr
              Map vocabulary to lowercase, eliminating case distinctions.

       --mmuullttiiwwoorrddss
              Split  multiwords  (words  joined  by '_') into their components
              when reading N-best lists.

       --mmuullttii--cchhaarr _C
              Character used to delimit  component  words  in  multiwords  (an
              underscore character by default).

       --rreessccoorree--llmmww _l_m_w
              Sets  the  language  model weight used in combining the language
              model log probabilities with acoustic  log  probabilities  (only
              relevant if separate scores are given in the N-best input).

       --rreessccoorree--wwttww _w_t_w
              Sets  the  word  transition  weight used to weight the number of
              words relative to the acoustic log probabilities (only  relevant
              if separate scores are given in the N-best input).

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--ssccaallee _s_c_a_l_e
              Divide the total weighted log score by _s_c_a_l_e when computing nor-
              malized posterior probabilities.  This controls  the  peakedness
              of  the  posterior  distribution.  The default value is whatever
              was chosen for --rreessccoorree--llmmww, so that language model  scores  are
              scaled to have weight 1, and acoustic scores have weight 1/_l_m_w.

       --aallll--nnggrraammss
              Causes  even  N-grams  that  occur in the reference string to be
              counted.  By default N-best N-grams that also occur in the  cor-
              responding reference are excluded.

       --mmiinn--ccoouunntt _C
              Prune all N-grams from the output that have counts less than _C.

       --rreeaadd--ccoouunnttss _c_o_u_n_t_s_f_i_l_e
              Read N-gram counts from a file.  Each line contains an N-gram of
              words, followed by an integer or fractional count, all separated
              by  whitespace.   Repeated counts for the same N-gram are added.
              N-grams from N-best lists are added  to  those  read  with  this
              option.

       --wwrriittee--ccoouunnttss _c_o_u_n_t_s_f_i_l_e
              Writes  total  N-gram  counts  to _c_o_u_n_t_s_f_i_l_e.  The default is to
              write to stdout.

       --ssoorrtt  Output counts in lexicographic order,  as  required  for  nnggrraamm--
              mmeerrggee(1).

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Set debugging output level.  Level 0 means no debugging.  Debug-
              ging messages are written to stderr.
