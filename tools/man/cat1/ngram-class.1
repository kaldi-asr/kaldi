       nnggrraamm--ccllaassss  induces word classes from distributional statistics, so as
       to minimize perplexity of a class-based N-gram model given the provided
       word  N-gram counts.  Presently, only bigram statistics are used, i.e.,
       the induced classes are best suited for a class-bigram language model.

       The program generates the class  N-gram  counts  and  class  expansions
       needed  by  nnggrraamm--ccoouunntt(1)  and  nnggrraamm(1), respectively to train and to
       apply the class N-gram model.

       Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a compressed file (name
       ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Set  debugging  output  at  _l_e_v_e_l.   Level 0 means no debugging.
              Debugging messages are written to stderr.   A  useful  level  to
              trace the formation of classes is 2.

       --vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read  a  vocabulary  from file.  Subsequently, out-of-vocabulary
              words in both counts or text are replaced with the  unknown-word
              token.   If  this  option  is  not specified all words found are
              implicitly added to the vocabulary.

       --ttoolloowweerr
              Map the vocabulary to lowercase.

       --ccoouunnttss _f_i_l_e
              Read N-gram counts from a file.  Each line contains an N-gram of
              words,  followed  by  an  integer count, all separated by white-
              space.  Repeated counts for the same N-gram are  added.   Counts
              collected by --tteexxtt and --ccoouunnttss are additive as well.
              Note that the input should contain consistent lower- and higher-
              order counts (i.e., unigrams and bigrams), as would be generated
              by nnggrraamm--ccoouunntt(1).

       --tteexxtt _t_e_x_t_f_i_l_e
              Generate  N-gram counts from text file.  _t_e_x_t_f_i_l_e should contain
              one sentence unit per line.  Begin/end sentence tokens are added
              if not already present.  Empty lines are ignored.

   CCllaassss MMeerrggiinngg
       --nnuummccllaasssseess _C
              The  target  number  of classes to induce.  A zero argument sup-
              presses automatic class merging altogether (e.g., for  use  with
              --iinntteerraacctt))..

       --ffuullll  Perform  full  greedy merging over all classes starting with one
              class per word.  This is the O(V^3) algorithm described in Brown
              et al. (1992).

       --iinnccrreemmeennttaall
              Perform incremental greedy merging, starting with one class each
              for the _C most frequent words, and then adding  one  word  at  a
              time.   This is the O(V*C^2) algorithm described in Brown et al.
              (1992); it is the default.

       --mmaaxxwwoorrddssppeerrccllaassss  MM
              Limits the number of words in a class to _M in incremental  merg-
              ing.  By default there is no such limit.

       --iinntteerraacctt
              Enter a primitive interactive interface when done with automatic
              class induction, allowing  manual  specification  of  additional
              merging steps.

       --nnooccllaassss--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read  a  list  of  vocabulary  items  from  _f_i_l_e  that are to be
              excluded from classes.  These words or tags do no undergo  class
              merging,  but  their N-gram counts still affect the optimization
              of model perplexity.
              The default is to exclude the sentence begin/end tags  (<s>  and
              </s>)  from  class merging; this can be suppressed by specifying
              --nnooccllaassss--vvooccaabb //ddeevv//nnuullll.

       --rreeaadd _f_i_l_e
              Read initial class memberships  from  _f_i_l_e.   Class  memberships
              need  to be stored in ccllaasssseess--ffoorrmmaatt(5) with the additional con-
              dition that probabilities are obligatory and that  each  member-
              ship definition must specify exactly one word.

       --ccllaassss--ccoouunnttss _f_i_l_e
              Write  class N-gram counts to _f_i_l_e when done.  The format is the
              same as for word N-gram  counts,  and  can  be  read  by  nnggrraamm--
              ccoouunntt(1) to estimate a class-N-gram model.

       --ccllaasssseess _f_i_l_e
              Write  class  definitions (member words and their probabilities)
              to _f_i_l_e when done.  The output format is the same as required by
              the --ccllaasssseess option of nnggrraamm(1).

       --ssaavvee _S
              Save  the  class  counts and/or class definitions every _S itera-
              tions during induction.  The filenames  are  obtained  from  the
              --ccllaassss--ccoouunnttss  and  --ccllaasssseess options, respectively, by appending
              the iteration number.  This is convenient for producing sets  of
              classes  at  different  granularities  during the same run.  The
              saved class memberships can also be used with the  --rreeaadd  option
              to  restart  class  merging  at a later time.  _S=0 (the default)
              suppresses the saving actions.

       --ssaavvee--mmaaxxccllaasssseess _K
              Modifies the action of --ssaavvee so as to only start saving once the
              number of classes reaches _K.  (The iteration numbers embedded in
              filenames will start at 0 from that point.)
