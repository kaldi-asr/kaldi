       mmeettaaddbb  retrieves  string  values associates with keys in configuration
       files.  The key(s) to be retrieved are  specified  as  arguments.   The
       configuration   file   is   located  through  the  enviroment  variable
       MMEETTAADDBB__CCOONNFFIIGG, possibly overridden by the --ccoonnffiigg option.

       Scripts and programs that need to operate on a variety of data or  with
       different  parameters  should  retrieve  all  variable  information via
       mmeettaaddbb.

       The format of a line in the configuration file is
            _k_e_y _v_a_l_u_e
       where _k_e_y is the first word in a line.  Anything starting with the sec-
       ond  word  is  the  _v_a_l_u_e  associated  with the _k_e_y.  Initial and final
       whitespace is removed, but otherwise whitespace can be embedded in  the
       _v_a_l_u_e.   Only the first of multiple lines with the same _k_e_y is signifi-
       cant for a lookup, unless the --aallll flag was given.

       The special key IINNCCLLUUDDEE is used to perform file inclusions:
            IINNCCLLUUDDEE /some/other/config/file
       allowing config files to ``inherit'' from  other  config  files.   Note
       that  key-value pairs preceding an inclusion override any identical key
       in the included file.

       The AALLIIAASS keyword redirects a lookup for one key _k_e_y_1 by another lookup
       for _k_e_y_2:
            AALLIIAASS _k_e_y_1 _k_e_y_2

       The  AALLIIAASS__SSUUFFFFIIXX  keyword  redirects  a lookup for any key with suffix
       _s_u_f_f_i_x_1 to another lookup with the suffix replaced by _s_u_f_f_i_x_2:
            AALLIIAASS__SSUUFFFFIIXX _s_u_f_f_i_x_1 _s_u_f_f_i_x_2
       This is a convenient way to apply a string mapping to an entire  family
       of  keys.   To  avoid  infinite  recursions and ambiguities in matching
       keys, the prefix of the key that is matched by _s_u_f_f_i_x_1 must no  contain
       any underscore characters.

       Lines  containing  only  whitespace  or  starting with a pound sign are
       ignored:
            # this is a comment

       There is also a primitive macro facility:
            DDEEFFIINNEE _s_t_r_i_n_g _s_t_r_i_n_g_2
       causes _s_t_r_i_n_g to be replaced by _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 in the output.
            SSDDEEFFIINNEE _s_t_r_i_n_g _c_o_m_a_n_d _a_r_g_1 _a_r_g_2 ...
       defines _s_t_r_i_n_g as a macro expanding to the first line of output of _c_o_m_-
       _m_a_n_d.  This also allows ``importing'' environment variables:
            SSDDEEFFIINNEE MACHINE_TYPE printenv MACHINE_TYPE
       (but  note  the expansion of macros inside the config file does not use
       dollar signs).
       The directive
            MMDDEEFFIINNEE _s_t_r_i_n_g _k_e_y
       defines _s_t_r_i_n_g as a macro expanding to the result  of  looking  up  _k_e_y
       using  mmeettaaddbb  itself  in  the current configuration file.  This allows
       piecing together of strings from various key values,  and  other  back-
       handed uses.
            UUNNDDEEFF _s_t_r_i_n_g
       undoes the definition of _s_t_r_i_n_g.

       Macros  are  expanded in key values, include filenames, and the defini-
       tions of other macros (at the time of definition).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ccoonnffiigg _f_i_l_e
              Use _f_i_l_e as the configuration file, instead of $$MMEETTAADDBB__CCOONNFFIIGG.

       --aallll   Return all key values, instead of the first value.  This  allows
              using multiple instances of a key to construct lists of strings.

       --dduummpp  Output  all  key-value  pairs found in the config file (prior to
              any values indexed by command line arguments).

       --iinncclluuddeess
              Trace the names of INCLUDEd files.

       --ee     Print an error message and exit with error status if a requested
              key value is undefined or empty.

       --qq     Check for the presence of a key and do not output key values.  A
              program exit status of 0 (``true'' to the shell) indicates  that
              at  least  one of the keys is present in the configuration file.
              Otherwise, a status of 1 (``false'' to the shell) is returned.

       Probably.
