       nbest-optimize - optimize score combination for N-best word error mini-
       mization

       nnbbeesstt--ooppttiimmiizzee [ --hheellpp ] _o_p_t_i_o_n ... [ _s_c_o_r_e_d_i_r ... ]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       nnbbeesstt--ooppttiimmiizzee reads a set of N-best lists, additional score files, and
       corresponding reference transcripts and optimizes the score combination
       weights so as to minimize the word error of a classifier that  performs
       word-level  posterior  probability maximization.  The optimized weights
       are meant to be used with nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee(1) and the --uussee--mmeesshh option, or
       the  nnbbeesstt--rroovveerr  script (see nnbbeesstt--ssccrriippttss(1)).  nnbbeesstt--ooppttiimmiizzee deter-
       mines both the best relative weighting of knowledge source  scores  and
       the  optimal --ppoosstteerriioorr--ssccaallee parameter that controls the peakedness of
       the posterior distribution.

       Alternatively, nnbbeesstt--ooppttiimmiizzee can also optimize weights for a standard,
       1-best  hypothesis  rescoring that selects entire (sentence) hypotheses
       (--11bbeesstt option).  In this mode sentence-level error counts may be  read
       from external files, or computed on the fly from the reference strings.
       The weights obtained are meant to be used  for  N-best  list  rescoring
       with rreessccoorree--rreewweeiigghhtt (see nnbbeesstt--ssccrriippttss(1)).

       A third optimization criterion is the BLEU score used in machine trans-
       lation.  This also requires the  associated  scores  to  be  read  from
       external files.

       One of three optimization algorithms are available:

       1.     The  default  optimization  method  is  gradient  descent  on  a
              smoothed (sigmoidal) approximation of the true  0/1  word  error
              function (Katagiri et al. 1990).  Therefore, the result can only
              be expected to be a _l_o_c_a_l minimum of the error surface.  (A more
              global  search can be attempted by specifying different starting
              points.)  Another approximation is that the  error  function  is
              computed  assuming  a  fixed  multiple  alignment  of all N-best
              hypotheses and the reference string,  which  tends  to  slightly
              overestimate the true pairwise error between any single hypothe-
              sis and the reference.

       2.     An alternative search strategy  uses  a  simplex-based  "Amoeba"
              search on the (non-smoothed) error function (Press et al. 1988).
              The search is restarted multiple times to avoid local minima.

       3.     A third algorithm uses Powell search (Press et al. 1988) on  the
              (non-smoothed) error function.

       Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a compressed file (name
       ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Controls the amount of output (the higher the _l_e_v_e_l, the  more).
              At  level 1, error statistics at each iteration are printed.  At
              level 2, word alignments are printed.  At level  3,  full  score
              matrix  is printed.  At level 4, detailed information about word
              hypothesis ranking is printed for each  training  iteration  and
              sample.

       --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess _f_i_l_e_-_l_i_s_t
              Specifies the set of N-best files as a list of filenames.  Three
              sets of standard scores are extracted from the N-best files: the
              acoustic  model  score, the language model score, and the number
              of words (for insertion penalty  computation).   See  nnbbeesstt--ffoorr--
              mmaatt(5) for details.
              In BLEU optimization mode, since there is no acoustic score, the
              position of the first score is  taken  by  the  "ac-replacement"
              score,  which  can  be any score used by the machine translation
              system.  A typical example is a score measuring word order  dis-
              tortion between the source and target languages.

       --ssrriinntteerrpp--ffoorrmmaatt
              Parse  n-best  list  in  SRInterp format, which has features and
              text in the same line. n-best optimize will also generate rover-
              control  file in SRInterp format, where each line is in the form
              of:
                   _F_1_=_V_1 _F_2_=_V_2 ... _F_m_=_V_m _W_1 _W_2 ..._W_n
              where _F_1 through _F_m are feature names, _V_1 through _V_m are feature
              values, _W_1 through _W_n are words.  Also generate SRInterp control
              file, in the format of:
                   _F_1_:_S_1 _F_2_:_S_2 ... _F_m_:_S_m
              where _S_1 through _S_m are scaling factors (weights) for feature _F_1
              through _F_m

       --rreeffss _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s
              Specifies  the  reference  transcripts.  Each line in _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s
              must contain the sentence ID (the last component in  the  N-best
              filename path, minus any suffixes) followed by zero or more ref-
              erence words.

       --iinnsseerrttiioonn--wweeiigghhtt _W
              Weight insertion errors by a factor _W.  This may  be  useful  to
              optimize for keyword spotting tasks where insertions have a cost
              different from deletion and substitution errors.

       --wwoorrdd--wweeiigghhttss _f_i_l_e
              Read a table of words and weights from _f_i_l_e.  Each word error is
              weighted  according  to  the  word-specific weight.  The default
              weight is 1, and used if a word has no specified weight.   Also,
              when this option is used, substitution errors are counted as the
              sum of a deletion and an insertion error, as opposed to counting
              as 1 error as in traditional word error computation.

       --aannttii--rreeffss _f_i_l_e
              Read  a  file  of  "anti-references" for use with the --aannttii--rreeff--
              wweeiigghhtt option (see below).

       --aannttii--rreeff--wweeiigghhtt _W
              Compute the hypothesis errors for 1-best optimization by  adding
              the  edit  distance  with respect to the "anti-references" times
              the weight _W to the regular error count.  If _W is negative  this
              will  tend  to  generate  hypotheses that are different from the
              anti-references (hence the name).

       --11bbeesstt Select  optimization  for  standard  sentence-level   hypothesis
              selection.

       --11bbeesstt--ffiirrsstt
              Optimized first using --11bbeesstt mode, then switch to full optimiza-
              tion.  This is an effective  way  to  quickly  bring  the  score
              weights  near  an optimal point, and then fine-tune them jointly
              with the posterior scale parameter.

       --eerrrroorrss _d_i_r
              In 1-best mode, optimize for error counts  that  are  stored  in
              separate  files  in directory _d_i_r.  Each N-best list must have a
              matching error counts file of the same basename  in  _d_i_r.   Each
              file contains 7 columns of numbers in the format
                   _w_c_r _w_e_r _n_s_u_b _n_d_e_l _n_i_n_s _n_e_r_r _n_w
              Only  the  last two columns (number of errors and words, respec-
              tively) are used.
              If this option is omitted, errors will be computed from  the  N-
              best hypotheses and the reference transcripts.

       --bblleeuu--ccoouunnttss _d_i_r
              Perform  BLEU  optimization,  reading BLEU reference counts from
              directory _d_i_r.  Each N-best list must  have  a  matching  counts
              file  of  the  same  basename  in  _d_i_r, containing the following
              information:
                   _N _M _L_1 ... _L_M
              where _N is the number of hypotheses in the N-best list, _M is the
              number  of  references  for the utterance, and _L_1 through _L_M are
              the reference lengths (word counts) for each reference.  Follow-
              ing this line, there are _N lines of the form
                   _K _C_1 _C_2 ... _C_m
              where  _K is the number of words in the hypothesis and _C_1 through
              _C_m are the N-gram counts occurring in the references for each N-
              gram order 1, ..., _m.  Currently, _m is limited to 4.

       --mmiinniimmuumm--bblleeuu--rreeffeerreennccee
              Use  shortest  reference  length  to  compute  the  BLEU brevity
              penalty.

       --cclloosseesstt--bblleeuu--rreeffeerreennccee
              Use closest reference length for each translation hypothesis  to
              compute the BLEU brevity penalty.

       --aavveerraaggee--bblleeuu--rreeffeerreennccee
              Use  average  reference  length  to  compute  the  BLEU  brevity
              penalty.

       --eerrrroorr--bblleeuu--rraattiioo  RR
              Specifies the weight of error rate when combined  with  BLEU  as
              optimization  objective:  _(_1_-_B_L_E_U_) _+ _E_R_R _x _R.  _E_R_R is error rate
              computed by #errors/#references.

       --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt _n
              Limits the number of hypotheses read from each  N-best  list  to
              the first _n.

       --rreessccoorree--llmmww _l_m_w
              Sets  the  language  model weight used in combining the language
              model log probabilities with acoustic log  probabilities.   This
              is used to compute initial aggregate hypotheses scores.

       --rreessccoorree--wwttww _w_t_w
              Sets  the  word  transition  weight used to weight the number of
              words relative to the acoustic log probabilities.  This is  used
              to compute initial aggregate hypotheses scores.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--ssccaallee _s_c_a_l_e
              Initial  value  for  scaling log posteriors.  The total weighted
              log score is divided by _s_c_a_l_e when computing  normalized  poste-
              rior  probabilities.  This controls the peakedness of the poste-
              rior distribution.  The default value is whatever was chosen for
              --rreessccoorree--llmmww,  so  that language model scores are scaled to have
              weight 1, and acoustic scores have weight 1/_l_m_w.

       --ccoommbbiinnee--lliinneeaarr
              Compute aggregate scores by linear combination, rather than log-
              linear  combination.   (This  is appropriate if the input scores
              represent log-posterior probabilities.)

       --nnoonn--nneeggaattiivvee
              Constrain search to non-negative weight values.

       --vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read the N-best list  vocabulary  from  _f_i_l_e.   This  option  is
              mostly  redundant  since  words  found  in  the N-best input are
              implicitly added to the vocabulary.

       --ttoolloowweerr
              Map vocabulary to lowercase, eliminating case distinctions.

       --mmuullttiiwwoorrddss
              Split multiwords (words joined by  '_')  into  their  components
              when reading N-best lists.

       --mmuullttii--cchhaarr _C
              Character  used  to  delimit  component  words in multiwords (an
              underscore character by default).

       --nnoo--rreeoorrddeerr
              Do not reorder the  hypotheses  for  alignment,  and  start  the
              alignment  with  the  reference  words.  The default is to first
              align hypotheses by order of decreasing scores (according to the
              initial  score  weighting) and then the reference, which is more
              compatible with how nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee(1) operates.

       --nnooiissee _n_o_i_s_e_-_t_a_g
              Designate _n_o_i_s_e_-_t_a_g as a vocabulary item that is to  be  ignored
              in  aligning  hypotheses  with each other (the same as the -pau-
              word).  This is typically used to identify a noise marker.

       --nnooiissee--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read several noise tags from _f_i_l_e, instead of,  or  in  addition
              to, the single noise tag specified by --nnooiissee.

       --hhiiddddeenn--vvooccaabb file
              Read  a subvocabulary from _f_i_l_e and constrain word alignments to
              only group those words that are either all  in  or  outside  the
              subvocabulary.   This  may be used to keep ``hidden event'' tags
              from aligning with regular words.

       --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy file
              Use word pronunciations listed in _f_i_l_e to construct word  align-
              ments  when  building  word  meshes.  This will use an alignment
              cost function that reflects the number of  inserted/deleted/sub-
              stituted  phones, rather than words.  The dictionary _f_i_l_e should
              contain one pronunciation per line, each naming a  word  in  the
              first field, followed by a string of phone symbols.

       --ddiissttaanncceess file
              Use the word distance matrix in _f_i_l_e as a cost function for word
              alignments.  Each line in _f_i_l_e defines a  row  of  the  distance
              matrix.   The  first  field  contains  the  word that is the row
              index, followed by one or more word/number pairs, where the word
              represents the column index and the number the distance value.

       --iinniitt--llaammbbddaass _'_w_1 _w_2 _._._._'
              Initialize  the score weights to the values specified (zeros are
              filled in for missing values).  The default is to set  the  ini-
              tial  acoustic model weight to 1, the language model weight from
              --rreessccoorree--llmmww, the word transition weight from --rreessccoorree--wwttww,  and
              all remaining weights to zero initially.  Prefixing a value with
              an equal sign (`=') holds the value  constant  during  optimiza-
              tion.  (All values should be enclosed in quotes to form a single
              command-line argument.)
              Hypotheses are aligned using the initial weights; thus, it makes
              sense  to  reoptimize with initial weights from a previous opti-
              mization in order to obtain alignments closer to the optimimum.

       --aallpphhaa _a
              Controls the error function smoothness; the sigmoid slope param-
              eter is set to _a.

       --eeppssiilloonn _e
              The step-size used in gradient descent (the multiple of the gra-
              dient vector).

       --mmiinn--lloossss _x
              Sets the loss function for a sample effectively to zero when its
              value falls below _x.

       --mmaaxx--ddeellttaa _d
              Ignores  the contribution of a sample to the gradient if the de-
              rivative exceeds _d.  This helps avoid numerical problems.

       --mmaaxxiitteerrss _m
              Stops optimization after _m iterations.  In Amoeba  search,  this
              limits  the  total  number of points in the parameter space that
              are evaluated.

       --mmaaxx--bbaadd--iitteerrss n
              Stops optimization after _n iterations during  which  the  actual
              (non-smoothed) error has not decreased.

       --mmaaxx--aammooeebbaa--rreessttaarrttss r
              Perform  only  up to _r repeated Amoeba searches.  The default is
              to search until _D searches give the same results, where _D is the
              dimensionality of the problem.

       --mmaaxx--ttiimmee _T
              Abort search if new lower-error point isn't found in _T seconds.

       --eeppssiilloonn--sstteeppddoowwnn _s

       --mmiinn--eeppssiilloonn _m
              If  _s  is  a  value greater than zero, the learning rate will be
              multiplied by _s every time the error does not decrease  after  a
              number  of  iterations  specified  by  --mmaaxx--bbaadd--iitteerrss.  Training
              stops when the learning rate falls below _m in this manner.

       --ccoonnvveerrggee _x
              Stops optimization when the  (smoothed)  loss  function  changes
              relatively by less than _x from one iteration to the next.

       --qquuiicckkpprroopp
              Use  the  approximate  second-order  method known as "QuickProp"
              (Fahlman 1989).

       --iinniitt--aammooeebbaa--ssiimmpplleexx _'_s_1 _s_2 _._._._'
              Perform Amoeba simplex search.  The argument  defines  the  step
              size  for  the  initial Amoeba simplex.  One value for each non-
              fixed search dimension should be specified,  plus  optionally  a
              value  for the posterior scaling parameter (which is searched as
              an added dimension).

       --iinniitt--ppoowweellll--rraannggee _'_a_1,,_b_1 _a_2,,_b_2 _._._._'
              Perform Powell  search.   The  argment  initializes  the  weight
              ranges  for  Powell  search.  One comma-separated pair of values
              for each search dimension should be specified. For  each  dimen-
              sion,  if the upper bound equals lower bound and initial lambda,
              that dimension will be fixed, even if not so specified by --iinniitt--
              llaammbbddaa ..

       --nnuumm--ppoowweellll--rruunnss _N
              Sets  the  number  of  random  runs for quick Powell grid search
              (default value is 20).

       --ddyynnaammiicc--rraannddoomm--sseerriieess
              Use time and process ID to initialize  seed  for  pseudo  random
              series  used in Powell search.  This will make results unrepeat-
              able but may yield better results through multiple trials.

       --pprriinntt--hhyyppss _f_i_l_e
              Write the best word hypotheses to _f_i_l_e after optimization.

       --pprriinntt--ttoopp--nn _N
              Write out the top _N rescored hypotheses.  In this  case  --pprriinntt--
              hhyyppss  specifies a directory (not a file) and one file per N-best
              list is generated.

       --pprriinntt--uunniiqquuee--hhyyppss
              Eliminate duplicate hypotheses when writing out N-best  hypothe-
              ses.

       --pprriinntt--oolldd--rraannkkss
              Output  the  original  hypothesis  ranks when writing out N-best
              hypotheses.

       --ccoommppuuttee--oorraaccllee
              Find the lowest error rate or the highest BLEU score  achievable
              by choosing among all N-best hypotheses.

       --pprriinntt--oorraaccllee--hhyyppss _f_i_l_e
              Print output oracle hyps to _f_i_l_e.

       --wwrriittee--rroovveerr--ccoonnttrrooll _f_i_l_e
              Writes  a  control  file for nnbbeesstt--rroovveerr to _f_i_l_e, reflecting the
              names of the input directories and the optimized parameter  val-
              ues.   The format of _f_i_l_e is described in nnbbeesstt--ssccrriippttss(1).  The
              file is rewritten for each new minimal error weight  combination
              found.
              In  BLEU  optimization,  the weight for the ac-replacement score
              will be written in the place of the posterior scale, since  pos-
              terior scaling is not used in BLEU optimization.

       --sskkiippoopptt
              Skip  optimization altogether, such as when only the --pprriinntt--hhyyppss
              function is to be exercised.

       ----     Signals the end of options,  such  that  following  command-line
              arguments  are interpreted as additional scorefiles even if they
              start with `-'.

       _s_c_o_r_e_d_i_r ...
              Any additional arguments  name  directories  containing  further
              score files.  In each directory, there must exist one file named
              after the sentence ID it corresponds to (the file may  also  end
              in  ``.gz''  and  contain compressed data).  The total number of
              score dimensions is thus 3 (for the standard scores from the  N-
              best list) plus the number of additional score directories spec-
              ified.

BBUUGGSS
       Gradient-based  optimization  is  not supported (yet) in 1-best or BLEU
       mode or  in  conjunction  with  the  --ccoommbbiinnee--lliinneeaarr  or  --nnoonn--nneeggaattiivvee
       options; use simplex or Powell search instead.
       The N-best directory in the control file output by --wwrriittee--rroovveerr--ccoonnttrrooll
       is inferred from the first N-best filename specified with --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess,
       and will therefore only work if all N-best lists are placed in the same
       directory.

       The --iinnsseerrttiioonn--wweeiigghhtt and --wwoorrdd--wweeiigghhttss options only  affect  the  word
       error  computation,  not  the  construction  of  hypothesis alignments.
       Also, they only apply to sausage-based, not 1-best error  optimization.
       (1-best errors may be explicitly specified using the --eerrrroorrss option).

       The  --aannttii--rreeffss  and  --aannttii--rreeff--wweeiigghhtt options do not work for sausage-
       based or BLEU optimization.
