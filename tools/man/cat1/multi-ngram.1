       mmuullttii--nnggrraamm  builds  N-gram  language  models  that contain multiwords,
       i.e., compound words that are a concatenation of words from some  prior
       given  model.  It will optionally generate multiword N-grams and insert
       them into an existing, reference N-gram model, so as  to  cover  multi-
       words  occuring  in a specified vocabulary.  It will then assign proba-
       bilities to the multiword N-grams so that word strings containing  mul-
       tiwords  have  the same probabilities as the strings of component words
       in the reference model.

       Note that the inverse operation (expanding a multiword N-gram  to  con-
       tain only regular words) is subsumed by the nnggrraamm --eexxppaanndd--ccllaasssseess func-
       tion.

       Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a compressed file (name
       ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --oorrddeerr _n
              Set  the  maximal  N-gram  order  to  be used from the reference
              model.  NOTE: The order of the model is  not  set  automatically
              when a model file is read, so the same file can be used at vari-
              ous orders.  To use models of order higher than 3 it  is  always
              necessary to specify this option.

       --mmuullttii--oorrddeerr _n
              The maximal N-gram order in the multiword-based model.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Set the debugging output level (0 means no debugging output).

       --vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Words  to  be  added  to  the model.  In particular, this should
              include all the multiwords to be added.

       --mmuullttii--cchhaarr _C
              Character used to delimit  component  words  in  multiwords  (an
              underscore character by default).

       --llmm _f_i_l_e
              Reference N-gram model.

       --mmuullttii--llmm _f_i_l_e
              Model  containing  multiwords; the N-grams in this model will be
              assigned new probabilities based on  the  reference  model.   If
              this option is _n_o_t given then the multiword model will be gener-
              ated by adding multiword N-grams to the reference model.

       --pprruunnee--uunnsseeeenn--nnggrraammss
              This option prevents the insertion of  multiword  N-grams  whose
              component N-grams are not contained in the reference model.  For
              example, for a multiword bigram "a_b c_d" to be inserted, a tri-
              gram  reference model must contain the trigrams "a b c" and "b c
              d".  If the reference model were a bigram LM, it would  have  to
              contain  "a  b",  "b c", and "c d".  This option is important to
              control the size of the multiword LM for large vocabularies.

BBUUGGSS
       This program is a hack for cases were the original training data is not
       available  and  a  multiword model has to be generated from an existing
       model.
       The resulting model is no longer properly normalized,  since  the  same
       word string can potentially be represented with or without multiwords.
       The  generation  of  multiword  N-grams uses a heuristic algorithm that
       works well for bigrams and trigrams, but is not exhaustive.
