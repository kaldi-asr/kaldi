DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       sseeggmmeenntt--nnbbeesstt processes a series of consecutive  N-best  lists  from  a
       speech recognizer and applies a hidden segment N-gram language model to
       them.  The language model is a standard backoff N-gram  model  in  ARPA
       nnggrraamm--ffoorrmmaatt(5)  modeling sentence segmentation using the boundary tags
       <s> and </s>.  The program reads in all N-best lists  and  outputs  the
       hypotheses  that have the highest aggregate (combined acoustic and lan-
       guage model) score.  Hypothesized sentence boundaries are marked by <s>
       tags.

       Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a compressed file (name
       ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --oorrddeerr _n
              Set the maximal N-gram order to be used, by  default  3.   NOTE:
              The  order  of  the  model is not set automatically when a model
              file is read, so the same file can be used at various orders.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Set the debugging output level (0 means  no  debugging  output).
              Debugging messages are sent to stderr.

       --llmm _f_i_l_e
              Read the N-gram model from _f_i_l_e.

       --ttoolloowweerr
              Map all vocabulary to lowercase.  Useful if case conventions for
              N-best lists and language model differ.

       --mmiixx--llmm _f_i_l_e
              Read a second, standard N-gram model for interpolation purposes.

       --llaammbbddaa _w_e_i_g_h_t
              Set the weight of the main model when interpolating  with  --mmiixx--
              llmm.  Default value is 0.5.

       --bbaayyeess _l_e_n_g_t_h
              Interpolate the second and the main model using posterior proba-
              bilities  for  local  N-gram-contexts  of  length  _l_e_n_g_t_h.   The
              --llaammbbddaa value is used as a prior mixture weight in this case.

       --bbaayyeess--ssccaallee _s_c_a_l_e
              Set  the  exponential  scale factor on the context likelihood in
              conjunction with the --bbaayyeess function.  Default value is 1.0.

       --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess _l_i_s_t
              Specifies a list of N-best files.  The file _l_i_s_t should  contain
              a  list  of filenames, one per line, each corresponding to an N-
              best file in one of the formats  described  in  nnbbeesstt--ffoorrmmaatt(5).
              The  N-best  files should correspond to consecutive speech wave-
              forms in the order listed.

       --ffbb--rreessccoorree
              Perform Forward-backward rescoring.  This generates  new  N-best
              lists  as output whose LM scores reflect the posterior probabil-
              ity of each hypothesis.   The  default  is  to  perform  Viterbi
              rescoring and output only the best combined hypothesis.

       --wwrriittee--nnbbeesstt--ddiirr _d_i_r
              Write  rescored N-best lists to directory _d_i_r instead of to std-
              out.  The filenames from the input are preserved.

       --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt _n
              Limits the number of hypotheses read from each  N-best  list  to
              the first _n.

       --mmaaxx--rreessccoorree _m
              Only  choose  among  the  top  _m  hypotheses of each list (after
              reordering hypotheses, see below).  This is an effective way  to
              limit  the quadratic computation of the Viterbi or forward/back-
              ward dynamic programming.

       --nnoo--rreeoorrddeerr
              Do not reorder the hypotheses before limiting the computation to
              the  top  _m.   By  default  the  hypotheses will first be sorted
              according to the acoustic and language model scores recorded  in
              the N-best lists.

       --rreessccoorree--llmmww _w_e_i_g_h_t
              Specifies  the  language  model  weight  to  be use in combining
              acoustic and language model scores to select the  best  hypothe-
              ses.

       --rreessccoorree--wwttww _w_e_i_g_h_t
              Specifies the word transition weight to be used in selecting the
              best hypotheses.

       --nnooiissee _n_o_i_s_e_-_t_a_g
              Designate _n_o_i_s_e_-_t_a_g as a vocabulary item that is to  be  ignored
              by the LM.  (This is typically used to identify a noise marker.)

       --nnooiissee--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read  several  noise  tags from _f_i_l_e, instead of, or in addition
              to, the single noise tag specified by --nnooiissee.

       --ddeecciipphheerr--llmm _m_o_d_e_l_-_f_i_l_e
              Designates the N-gram backoff model (typically  a  bigram)  that
              was  used  by the Decipher(TM) recognizer in computing composite
              scores.  Used to compute  acoustic  scores  from  the  composite
              scores if the N-best lists are in "NBestList1.0" format.

       --ddeecciipphheerr--llmmww _w_e_i_g_h_t
              Specifies  the  language  model  weight  used by the recognizer.
              Used to compute acoustic scores from the composite scores.

       --ddeecciipphheerr--wwttww _w_e_i_g_h_t
              Specifies the word transition weight  used  by  the  recognizer.
              Used to compute acoustic scores from the composite scores.

       --ssttaagg _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Use _s_t_r_i_n_g to mark segment boundaries in the output.  Default is
              the start-of-sentence  symbol  defined  in  the  language  model
              (<s>).

       --bbiiaass _b
              Make  a  segment boundary a priori more likely by a factor of _b.
              If _b is 0, the dynamic program algorithm is restricted to  never
              consider  hidden  sentence  boundaries; this is useful when sseegg--
              mmeenntt--nnbbeesstt is used merely for its ability to apply the LM across
              N-best boundaries.

       --ssttaarrtt--ttaagg _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Insert a tag _s_t_r_i_n_g at the front of every N-best hypothesis read
              in.

       --eenndd--ttaagg _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Insert a tag _s_t_r_i_n_g at the end of every N-best  hypothesis  read
              in.   This  and  the  previous option are useful if the LM marks
              acoustic waveform boundaries with a special tag.

       sseeggmmeenntt--nnbbeesstt will also process any command  line  arguments  following
       the  options as lists of N-best lists, as with the --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess option.
       Each _n_b_e_s_t_-_f_i_l_e_-_l_i_s_t will be processed in turn, with individual  output
       delimited by a line of the form
            <nbestfile _n_b_e_s_t_-_f_i_l_e_-_l_i_s_t>

       N-gram  models  of  arbitrary order can be used, but the context at the
       beginning of a hypothesis never extends beyond the words from the  pre-
       ceding N-best list.
