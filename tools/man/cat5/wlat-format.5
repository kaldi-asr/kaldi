DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Word  posterior  lattices and meshes are lattices generated by aligning
       N-best hypotheses with nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee(1), or by  aligning  PFSG  or  HTK
       lattices  with  llaattttiiccee--ttooooll(1).   They  compactly encode possible word
       hypotheses sequences and their posterior probabilities.   (Word  meshes
       have become generally known as ``confusion networks'' or ``sausages.'')

       A  word lattice is a partially ordered directed graph with nodes repre-
       senting word hypotheses.  Nodes are identified  by  non-negative  inte-
       gers.   The file format specifies the initial node _i, the final node _f,
       and any number of additional nodes _n.  For each node  _n  the  following
       associated  information  is given on the same line: the word identity _w
       (the string ``NULL'' is used with initial and final nodes), the  align-
       ment  position  _a  (identical  values in this field identify hypotheses
       that occur at the same position), and the word posterior probability _p.
       Following these values, zero or more transitions to successor nodes are
       specified, each given by the node index _n_i and the transition posterior
       probability  _p_i.   In a properly normalized word lattice the transition
       posteriors _p_i sum up to the node posterior _p.

       Word meshes represent a more constrained lattice format in  which  word
       hypotheses are in a total order.  A mesh contains a number of alignment
       positions, and a set of mutually  exclusive  word  hypotheses  in  each
       position  (the  ``confusion sets'').  The word mesh represents all sen-
       tence hypotheses  that  can  be  generated  by  freely  combining  word
       hypotheses  at  each position.  The file format specifies the number of
       alignment positions _A and the total posterior probability mass  _P  con-
       tained in the lattice, followed by one or more confusion set specifica-
       tions.  For each alignment position _a, the hypothesized  words  _w_i  and
       their  posterior  probabilities  _p_i  are  listed  in  alternation.  The
       pseudo-word string **DDEELLEETTEE** represents an empty hypothesis.

       Optionally, the word mesh format encodes additional  information  about
       the hypothesis alignment from which it resulted.  The keyword rreeffeerreennccee
       specifies the correct word _w that was aligned at position _a.  The  key-
       word  hhyyppss  is  used to list the sentence hypotheses of which a certain
       word hypothesis was a part.  The word hypothesis is  identified  by  an
       alignment postion _a and the word string _w, and is followed by the inte-
       ger IDs _h_i (typically, the N-best ranks)  of  the  associated  sentence
       hypotheses.

       As  another  optional  element,  the  word  mesh can contain word-level
       acoustic and temporal information,  following  the  keyword  iinnffoo,  the
       alignment  position  _a,  and  the word identity _w.  This information is
       derived by nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee(1) from word- and phone-level backtraces of N-
       best  hypotheses (as represented in Decipher NBestList2.0 format).  The
       details of this information are  defined  in  the  SRILM  class  NNBBeesstt--
       WWoorrddIInnffoo  and  subject  to change, but currently include the following.
       _s_t_a_r_t: word start time (in seconds from the beginning of the waveform);
       _d_u_r: word duration (in seconds); _a_s_c_o_r_e: acoustic model likelihood (log
       base 10); _g_s_c_o_r_e: grammar (LM and pronunciation) score (log  base  10);
       _p_h_o_n_e_s:  sequence  of  phones in word (separated by colons); _p_h_o_n_e_d_u_r_s:
       sequence of  phone  durations  (in  numbers  of  frames,  separated  by
       colons).   When  word meshes are derived from HTK format lattices, pro-
       nunciation field will consist of the HTK phone  alignment  information,
       which  encodes  both  phone  sequence and durations; the phone duration
       field in turn is used to encode the duration model scores, if  present.
       NNoottee::  The encoded information pertains to the word hypothesis with the
       highest posterior probability among all hypotheses  of  the  same  word
       aligned to a given word mesh position.

       Both formats optionally encode the associated utterance IDs in the nnaammee
       field.  Word lattices and meshes can be converted to PFSG format  using
       the script wwllaatt--ttoo--ppffssgg.

       Detailed alignment and acoustic information is so far only  implemented
       for  word  meshes, although conceptually it would apply equally to word
       lattices.
