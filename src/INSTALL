These instructions are valid for UNIX-like systems (these steps have
been run on various Linux distributions; Darwin; Cygwin).  For native Windows
compilation, see ../windows/INSTALL.

You must first have completed the installation steps in ../tools/INSTALL
(compiling OpenFst; getting ATLAS and CLAPACK headers).

The installation instructions are:
./configure --shared
make depend
make

Note that "make" takes a long time; you can speed it up by running make
in parallel if you have multiple CPUs, for instance
 make depend -j 8
 make -j 8
