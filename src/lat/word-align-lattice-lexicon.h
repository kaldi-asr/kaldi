/** Read the lexicon in the special format required for word alignment.  Each line has
   a series of integers on it (at least two on each line), representing:

   <old-word-id> <new-word-id> [<phone-id-1> [<phone-id-2> ... ] ]

   Here, <old-word-id> is the word-id that appears in the lattice before alignment, and
   <new-word-id> is the word-is that should appear in the lattice after alignment.  This
   is mainly useful when the lattice may have no symbol for the optional-silence arcs
   (so <old-word-id> would equal zero), but we want it to be output with a symbol on those
   arcs (so <new-word-id> would be nonzero).
   If the silence should not be added to the lattice, both <old-word-id> and <new-word-id>
   may be zero.

   This function is very simple: it just reads in a series of lines from a text file,
   each with at least two integers on them.
