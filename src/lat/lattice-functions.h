   This function extracts the per-frame log likelihoods from a linear
   lattice (which we refer to as an 'nbest' lattice elsewhere in Kaldi code).
   The dimension of *per_frame_loglikes will be set to the
   number of input symbols in 'nbest'.  The elements of
   '*per_frame_loglikes' will be set to the .Value2() elements of the lattice
   weights, which represent the acoustic costs; you may want to scale this
   vector afterward by -1/acoustic_scale to get the original loglikes.
   If there are acoustic costs on input-epsilon arcs or the final-prob in 'nbest'
   (and this should not normally be the case in situations where it makes
   sense to call this function), they will be included to the cost of the
   preceding input symbol, or the following input symbol for input-epsilons
   encountered prior to any input symbol.  If 'nbest' has no input symbols,
   'per_frame_loglikes' will be set to the empty vector.

/**
   This function implements either the MPFE (minimum phone frame error) or SMBR
   (state-level minimum bayes risk) forward-backward, depending on whether
   "criterion" is "mpfe" or "smbr".  It returns the MPFE
   criterion of SMBR criterion for this utterance, and outputs the posteriors (which
   may be positive or negative) into "post".

   @param [in] trans    The transition model. Used to map the
                        transition-ids to phones or pdfs.
   @param [in] silence_phones   A list of integer ids of silence phones. The
                        silence frames i.e. the frames where num_ali
                        corresponds to a silence phones are treated specially.
                        The behavior is determined by 'one_silence_class'
                        being false (traditional behavior) or true.
                        Usually in our setup, several phones including
                        the silence, vocalized noise, non-spoken noise
                        and unk are treated as "silence phones"
   @param [in] lat      The denominator lattice
   @param [in] num_ali  The numerator alignment
   @param [in] criterion    The objective function. Must be "mpfe" or "smbr"
                        for MPFE (minimum phone frame error) or sMBR
                        (state minimum bayes risk) training.
   @param [in] one_silence_class   Determines how the silence frames are treated.
                        Setting this to false gives the old traditional behavior,
                        where the silence frames (according to num_ali) are
                        treated as incorrect. However, this means that the
                        insertions are not penalized by the objective.
                        Setting this to true gives the new behaviour, where we
                        treat silence as any other phone, except that all pdfs
                        of silence phones are collapsed into a single class for
                        the frame-error computation. This can possible reduce
                        the insertions in the trained model. This is closer to
                        the WER metric that we actually care about, since WER is
                        generally computed after filtering out noises, but
                        does penalize insertions.
    @param [out] post   The "MBR posteriors" i.e. derivatives w.r.t to the
                        pseudo log-likelihoods of states at each frame.
