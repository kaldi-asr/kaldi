#This directory contains some of the source for the Doxygen documentation (the
#code itself, and its comments, is the rest of the source).  Doxygen will create
#the actual documentation in ../html/ (e.g. open ../html/index.html in a browser).
#To run doxygen, type "doxygen" from one directory above this.  If this does
#not work, search for "Kaldi main page" online and you will hopefully get a 
#version of the documentation.

# Note: I generally run this file by typing ". doc/README" from src/,
# but this relies on having dsa encryption set up  with Sourceforge.
# instructions (from Vassil Panayotov) on how to do this:
# type
#ssh-keygen -t dsa -C "vpanayotov@shell.sf.net"
#ssh-add
# end then import the contents of .ssh/id_dsa.pub into
# http://sourceforge.net/account/services 

#(from Dan:) The commands below show how I compile the documentation and copy it
#to the homepage at sourceforge.  I do this from JHU at the current time.

# cd to src/
doc/make_tools.sh
doxygen
cp doc/*.pptx html/;


tar -czf html.tar.gz html
scp html.tar.gz danielpovey@web.sourceforge.net:/home/project-web/kaldi/htdocs/

#may have to do this:
ssh danielpovey,kaldi@shell.sourceforge.net create

# Running the shell command on sourceforge, from svatava:
echo 'cd /home/project-web/kaldi/htdocs/; rm -rf html;
     tar -xzf html.tar.gz; for x in html/*; do mv $x .; done ' \
   | ssh danielpovey,kaldi@shell.sourceforge.net bash
