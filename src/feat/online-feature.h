/**
   This class does an online version of the cepstral mean and [optionally]
   variance, but note that this is not equivalent to the offline version.  This
   is necessarily so, as the offline computation involves looking into the
   future.  If you plan to use features normalized with this type of CMVN then
   you need to train in a `matched' way, i.e. with the same type of features.
   We normally only do so in the "online" GMM-based decoding, e.g.  in
   online2bin/online2-wav-gmm-latgen-faster.cc; see also the script
   steps/online/prepare_online_decoding.sh and steps/online/decode.sh.

   In the steady state (in the middle of a long utterance), this class
   accumulates CMVN statistics from the previous "cmn_window" frames (default 600
   frames, or 6 seconds), and uses these to normalize the mean and possibly
   variance of the current frame.

   The config variables "speaker_frames" and "global_frames" relate to what
   happens at the beginning of the utterance when we have seen fewer than
   "cmn_window" frames of context, and so might not have very good stats to
   normalize with.  Basically, we first augment any existing stats with up
   to "speaker_frames" frames of stats from previous utterances of the current
   speaker, and if this doesn't take us up to the required "cmn_window" frame
   count, we further augment with up to "global_frames" frames of global
   stats.  The global stats are CMVN stats accumulated from training or testing
   data, that give us a reasonable source of mean and variance for "typical"
   data.
