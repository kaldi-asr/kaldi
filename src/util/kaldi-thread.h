// This header provides convenient mechanisms for parallelization.
//
// The class MultiThreader, and the function RunMultiThreaded provide a
// mechanism to run a specified number of jobs in parellel and wait for them
// all to finish. They accept objects of some class C that derives from the
// base class MultiThreadable. C needs to define the operator () that takes
// no arguments. See ExampleClass below.
//
// The class TaskSequencer addresses a different problem typically encountered
// in Kaldi command-line programs that process a sequence of items. The items
// to be processed are coming in. They are all of different sizes, e.g.
// utterances with different numbers of frames. We would like them to be
// processed in parallel to make good use of the threads available but they
// must be output in the same order they came in. Here, we again accept objects
// of some class C with an operator () that takes no arguments. C may also have
// a destructor with side effects (typically some kind of output).
// TaskSequencer is responsible for running the jobs in parallel. It has a
// function Run() that will accept a new object of class C; this will block
// until a thread is free, at which time it will spawn a thread that starts
// running the operator () of the object. When threads are finished running,
// the objects will be deleted. TaskSequencer guarantees that the destructors
// will be called sequentially (not in parallel) and in the same order the
// objects were given to the Run() function, so that it is safe for the
// destructor to have side effects such as outputting data.
// Note: the destructor of TaskSequencer will wait for any remaining jobs that
// are still running and will call the destructors.
