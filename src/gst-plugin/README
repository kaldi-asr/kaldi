= Kaldi Gstreamer plugin =

Plugin for GSteramer 1.0 framework, using the OnlineGmmDecodeFaster 
decoder. Accepts 16000 kHz 16 bit audio and decodes it on the fly,
decoder words are "pushed" out using a callback.


== Requirements ==

Development packages for Gstreamer 1.0 (libgstreamer1.0-dev on Debian)


== Install ==

Compile rest of the Kaldi with -fPIC. To do this, edit the kaldi.mk
file and modify:

    CXXFLAGS = -fPIC -m64 -msse -msse2 -Wall -I.. \
    [...]

This will probably change when the sharedlibs functionality is merged to
the trunk.

Also, make the online extensions  (make ext)

Now, just run make.

== Usage ==

See egs/voxforge/gst_demo
