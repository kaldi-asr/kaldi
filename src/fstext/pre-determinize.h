   higher than the largest-numbered symbol currently in the FST.  The new

/** AddSelfLoops is a function you will probably want to use alongside PreDeterminize,
    to add self-loops to any FSTs that you compose on the left hand side of the one
    modified by PreDeterminize.

    This function inserts loops with "special symbols" [e.g. \#0, \#1] into an FST.
    This is done at each final state and each state with non-epsilon output symbols on
    at least one arc out of it.  This is to ensure that these symbols, when inserted into
    the input side of an FST we will compose with on the right, can "pass through" this
    FST.

    At input, isyms and osyms must be vectors of the same size n, corresponding
    to symbols that currently do not exist in 'fst'.  For each state in n that has
    non-epsilon symbols on the output side of arcs leaving it, or which is a final state,
    this function inserts n self-loops with unit weight and one of the n pairs
    of symbols on its input and output.
