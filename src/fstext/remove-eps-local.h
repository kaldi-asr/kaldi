/// RemoveEpsLocal remove some (but not necessarily all) epsilons in an FST,
/// using an algorithm that is guaranteed to never increase the number of arcs
/// in the FST (and will also never increase the number of states).  The
/// algorithm is not optimal but is reasonably clever.  It does not just remove
/// epsilon arcs;it also combines pairs of input-epsilon and output-epsilon arcs
/// into one.
/// The algorithm preserves equivalence and stochasticity in the given semiring.
/// If you want to preserve stochasticity in a different semiring (e.g. log),
/// then use RemoveEpsLocalSpecial, which only words for StdArc but which
/// preserves stochasticity, where possible (*) in the LogArc sense.  The reason that we can't
/// just cast to a different semiring is that in that case we would no longer
/// be able to guarantee equivalence in the original semiring (this arises from
/// what happens when we combine identical arcs).
/// (*) by "where possible".. there are situations where we wouldn't be able to
/// preserve stochasticity in the LogArc sense while maintaining equivalence in
/// the StdArc sense, so in these situations we maintain equivalence.
