/* This header defines a special form of the context FST "C" (the "C" in "HCLG")
   that integrates with our framework for building dynamic graphs for grammars
   that are too big to statically create, or graphs with on-the-fly pieces that
   you want to create at recognition time without building the whole graph.

   This framework is limited to only work with models with left-biphone context.
   (Fortunately this doesn't impact results, as our best models are all 'chain'
   models with left biphone context).

   The main code exported from here is the class InverseLeftBiphoneContextFst,
   which is similar to the InverseContextFst defined in context-fst.h, but
   is limited to left-biphone context and also supports certain special
   extensions we need to compile grammars.

   See \ref grammar (../doc/grammar.dox) for high-level
   documentation on how this framework works.

   This is a variant of the function ComposeContext() which is to be used

   ../doc/grammar.dox, for more details).  This does not take
   the 'context_width' and 'central_position' arguments because they are
   assumed to be 2 and 1 respectively (meaning, left-biphone phonetic context).

   This function creates a context FST and composes it on the left with "ifst"
   to make "ofst".

    @param [in] nonterm_phones_offset  The integer id of the symbol
                  #nonterm_bos in the phones.txt file.  You can just set this
                  to a large value (like 1 million) if you are not actually using
                  nonterminals (e.g. for testing purposes).
    @param [in] disambig_syms  List of disambiguation symbols, e.g. the integer
                 ids of #0, #1, #2 ... in the phones.txt.
    @param [in,out] ifst   The FST we are composing with C (e.g. LG.fst).
    @param [out] ofst   Composed output FST (would be CLG.fst).
    @param [out] ilabels  Vector, indexed by ilabel of CLG.fst, providing information
                  about the meaning of that ilabel; see \ref tree_ilabel

/*
   InverseLeftBiphoneContextFst represents the inverse of the context FST "C" (the "C" in
   "HCLG") which transduces from symbols representing phone context windows
   (e.g. "a, b, c") to individual phones, e.g. "a".  So InverseContextFst
   transduces from phones to symbols representing phone context windows.  The
   point is that the inverse is deterministic, so the DeterministicOnDemandFst
   interface is applicable, which turns out to be a convenient way to implement
   this.

   This doesn't implement the full Fst interface, it implements the
   DeterministicOnDemandFst interface which is much simpler and which is
   sufficient for what we need to do with this.

   Transducers") by M. Mohri, for more context.

  /**
     Here is a note on the state space of InverseLeftBiphoneContextFst;
     see \ref grammar_special_c which has some documentation on this.

     The state space uses the same numbering as phones.txt.

       State 0 means the beginning-of-sequence state, where there is no left
       context.

       For each phone p in the list 'phones' passed to the constructor (i.e. in
       the set passed to the constructor), the state 'p' corresponds to a
       left-context of that phone.

       If p is equal to nonterm_phones_offset_ + kNontermBegin (i.e. the
       integer form of `\#nonterm_begin`), then this is the state we transition
       to when we see that symbol starting from left-context==0 (no context).  The
       transition to this special state will have epsilon on the output.  (talking
       here about inv(C), not C, so input/output are reversed).
       The state is nonfinal and when we see a regular phone p1 or #nonterm_bos, instead of
       outputting that phone in context, we output the pair (#nonterm_begin,p1) or
       (#nonterm_begin,#nonterm_bos).  This state is not final.

       If p is equal to nonterm_phones_offset_ + kNontermUserDefined, then this
       is the state we transition to when we see any user-defined nonterminal.
       Transitions to this special state have olabels of the form (#nonterm:foo,p1)
       where p1 is the preceding context (with #nonterm_begin if that context was
       0); transitions out of it have olabels of the form (#nonterm_reenter,p2), where
       p2 is the phone on the ilabel of that transition.  Again: talking about inv(C).
       This state is not final.

       If p is equal to nonterm_phones_offset_ + kNontermEnd, then this is
       the state we transition to when we see the ilabel #nonterm_end.  The olabels
       on the transitions to it (talking here about inv(C), so ilabels and olabels
       are reversed) are of the form (#nonterm_end, p1) where p1 corresponds to the
       context we were in.  This state is final.
