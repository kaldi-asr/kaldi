  Predeterminization

    This is a function that makes an FST compactly determinizable by inserting symbols on the input
  side as necessary for disambiguation.  Note that we do not treat epsilon as a real symbol
  when measuring determinizability in this sense.   The extra symbols are added to the vocabulary,
  on the input side; these are of the form (prefix)1, (prefix)2, and so on without limit, where
  (prefix) is some prefix the user provides, e.g. '#' (the function checks that this will not
  lead to conflicts with symbols already in the FST).  The function tells us how many such
  symbols it created.

   Note that there is a paper "Generalized optimization algorithm for speech recognition
   transducers" by Allauzen and Mohri, that deals with a similar issue, but this is a very
   different algorithm that only aims to ensure determinizability, but not *compact*
   determinizability.

   Our algorithm is slightly heuristic, and probably not optimal, but does ensure that the
   output is compactly determinizable, possibly at the expense of inserting unnecessary
   symbols.  We considered more sophisticated algorithms, but these were extremely
   complicated and would give the same output for the kinds of inputs that we envisage.

   Suppose the input FST is T.  We want to ensure that in det(T), if we consider the
   states of det(T) as weighted subsets of states of T, each state of T only appears once
   in any given subset.  This ensures that det(T) is no larger than T in an appropriate
   sense.  The way we do this is as follows.  We identify all states in T that have
   multiple input transitions (counting "being an initial state" as an input transition).
   Let's call these "problematic" states.  For a problematic state p we stipulate that it
   can never appear in any state of det(T) unless that state equals (p, \bar{1}) [i.e. p,
   unweighted].  In order to ensure this, we insert input symbols on the transitions to these
   problematic states (this may necessitate adding extra states).
      We also stipulate that the path through det(T) should always be sufficient to tell us
   the path through T (and we insert extra symbols sufficient to make this so).  This is to
   simplify the algorithm, so that we don't have to consider the output symbols or weights
   when predeterminizing.

   The algorithm is as follows.

    (A) Definitions

      (i)  Define a *problematic state* as a state that either has multiple input transitions,
           or is an initial state and has at least one input transition.

     (ii)  For an arc a, define:
            i[a] = input symbol on a
            o[a] = output symbol on a
            n[a] = dest-state of a
            p[a] = origin-state of a

           For a state q, define
            E[q] = set of transitions leaving q.
           For a set of states Q, define
            E[Q] = set of transitions leaving some q in Q

    (iii)  For a state s, define Closure(s) as the union of state s, and all states t
           that are reachable via sequences of arcs a such that i[a]=epsilon and n[a] is
           not problematic.

           For a set of states S, define Closure(S) as the union of the closures of
           states s in S.

    (B) Inputs and outputs.

     (i) Inputs and preconditions.  Input is an FST, which should have a symbol table compiled into
         it, and a prefix (e.g. #) for symbols to be added.  We check that the input FST is trim,
         and that it does not have any symbols that appear on its arcs, that are equal to the prefix
         followed by digits.

    (ii) Outputs: The algorithm modifies the FST that is given to it, and returns the number of
         the highest numbered "extra symbol" inserted.  The extra symbols are numbered #1, #2 and
         so on without limit (as integers).  They are inserted into the symbol table in a sequential
         way by calling AvailableKey()
         for each in turn (this is stipulated in case we need to keep other symbol tables in sync).

     (C) Sub-algorithm: Closure(S).  This requires the array p(s), defined below, which is true
         if s is problematic.  This also requires, for efficiency, that the arcs be sorted on input
         label.
            Input: a set of states S.  [plus, the fst and the array p].
            Output: a set of states T.
            Algorithm:
                set T <-- S, Q <-- S.
                while Q is nonempty:
                  pop a state s from Q.
                  for each transition a from state s with epsilon on the input label [we can
                    find these efficiently using the sorting on arcs]:
                      If p(n[a]) is false and n[a] is not in T:
                         Insert n[a] into T.
                         Add n[a] to Q.
                return T.


     (D) Main algorithm.


       (i) (a) Check preconditions (FST is trim)
           (b) Make sure there is just one final state (insert epsilon transitions as necessary).
           (c) Sort arcs on input label (so epsilon arcs are at the start of arc lists).


      (ii) Work out the set of problematic states by constructing a boolean array indexed by
           states, i.e.
             p(s)
           which is true if the state is problematic.  We can do this by constructing an array
           t(s) to store the number of transitions into each state [adding one for the initial state],
           and then setting p(s) = true if t(s) > 1.

           Also create a boolean array d(s), defined for states, and set d(s) = false.
           This array is purely for sanity-checking that we are processing each state exactly once.

     (iii) Set up an array of integers m(a), indexed by arcs (how exactly we store these is
           implementation-dependent, but this will probably be a hash from (state, arc-index) to
           integers.  m(a) will store the extra symbol, if any, to be added to that arc (or -1
           if no such symbol; we can also simply have the arc not present in the hash).  The
           initial value of m(a) is -1 (if array), or undefined (if hash).

      (iv) Initialize a set of sets-of-states S, and a queue of pairs Q, as follows.
            The pairs in Q are a pair of (set-of-states, integer), where the integer
            is the number of "special symbols" already used up for that state.

            Note that we use a special indexing for the sets in both S and Q, rather than
            using std::set.  We use a sorted vector of StateId's.  And in S, we index them
            by the lowest-numbered state-id.  Because each state is supposed to only ever
            be a member of one set, if there is an attempt to add another, different set
            with the same lowest-numbered state-id, we detect an error.

            Let I be the single initial state (OpenFST only supports one).
            We set:
              S = { Closure(I) }
              Push (Closure(I), 0)  onto Q.
            Then for each state s such that p(s) = true, and s is not an initial state:
              S <-- S u { Closure(s) }
              Push (Closure(s), 0)  onto Q.

       (v) While Q is nonempty:

          (a) Pop pair (A, n) from Q (queue discipline is arbitrary).

          (b) For each state s in A, check that d(s) is false, and set d(s) to true.
              This is for sanity checking only.

          (c)
             Let S_\eps be the set of epsilon-transitions from members of A to problematic
             states (i.e. S_\eps = \{ a \in E[A]: i[a]=\epsilon, p(n[a]) = true \}).

             Next, we will define, for each t \neq \epsilon, S_t as the set of
               transitions from some state s in S with t as the input label, i.e.:
               S_t = \{ a \in E[A]: i[a] = t \}
               We further define T_t and U_t as the subsets of S where the destination
                 state is problematic and non-problematic respectively, i.e:
               T_t = \{ a \in E[A]: i[a] = t, p(n[a]) = true \}
               U_t = \{ a \in E[A]: i[a] = t, p(n[a]) = false \}

             The easiest way to obtain these sets is probably to have a hash indexed by
               t that maps to a list of pairs (state, arc-offset) that stores S_t.
               From this we can work out the sizes of T_t and U_t on the fly.

         (d)
             for each transition a in S_\eps:
                m(a) <-- n # Will put symbol n on this transition.
                n <-- n+1  # Note, same n as in pair (A, n)

         (e)
             next,
             for each t\neq epsilon s.t. S_t is nonempty,

                if |S_t| > 1 #if-statement is because if |S_t|=|T_t|=1, no need for prefix.
                   k = 0
                   for each transition a in T_t:
                     set m(a) to k.
                     set k = k+1

                if |U_t| > 0
                   Let V_t be the set of destination-states of arcs in U_t.
                   if Closure(V_t) is not in S:
                     insert Closure(V_t) into S, and add the pair (Closure(V_t), k) to Q.

       (vi) Check that for each state in the FST, d(s) = true.

      (vii) Let n = max_a m(a).  This is the highest-numbered extra symbol (extra symbols
            start from zero, in this numbering which doesn't correspond to the symbol-table
            numbering).  Here we add n+1 extra symbols to the symbol table and store
            the mappings from 0, 1, ... n to the symbol-id.

     (viii) Set up a hash h from (state, int) to (state-id) such that
             t = h(s, k)
            will be the state-id of a newly-created state that has a transition to state s
            with input-label #k.

      (ix) For each arc a such that m(a) != 0:
             If i[a] = epsilon (the input label is epsilon):
                Change i[a] to #m(a). [i.e. prefix then digit m(a)]
             Otherwise:
                If t = h(n[a], m(a)) is not defined [where n[a] is the dest-state]:
                  create a new state t with a transition to n[a], with input-label #m(a) and
                  no output-label or weight.  Set h(n[a], m(a)) = t.
                Change n[a] to h(n[a], m(a)).
