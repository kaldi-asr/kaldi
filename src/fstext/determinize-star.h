/*
   DeterminizeStar implements determinization with epsilon removal, which we
   distinguish with a star.
   
   We define a determinized* FST as one in which no state has more than one
   transition with the same input-label.  Epsilon input labels are not allowed
   except starting from states that have exactly one arc exiting them (and are
   not final).  [In the normal definition of determinized, epsilon-input labels
   are not allowed at all, whereas in Mohri's definition, epsilons are treated
   as ordinary symbols].  The determinized* definition is intended to simulate
   the effect of allowing strings of output symbols at each state.

   The algorithm implemented here takes an Fst<Arc>, and a pointer to a
   MutableFst<Arc> where it puts its output.  The weight type is assumed to be a
   float-weight.  It does epsilon removal and determinization.
   This algorithm may fail if the input has epsilon cycles under
   certain circumstances (i.e. the semiring is non-idempotent, e.g. the log
   semiring, or there are negative cost epsilon cycles).  
   
   This implementation is much less fancy than the one in fst/determinize.h, and
   does not have an "on-demand" version.

   The algorithm is a fairly normal determinization algorithm.  We keep in
   memory the subsets of states, together with their leftover strings and their
   weights.  The only difference is we detect input epsilon transitions and
   treat them "specially".
*/


// This algorithm will be slightly faster if you sort the input fst on input label.

/**
    This function implements the normal version of DeterminizeStar, in which the
    output strings are represented using sequences of arcs, where all but the
    first one has an epsilon on the input side.  The debug_ptr argument is an
    optional pointer to a bool that, if it becomes true while the algorithm is
    executing, the algorithm will print a traceback and terminate (used in
    fstdeterminizestar.cc debug non-terminating determinization).
    If max_states is positive, it will stop determinization and throw an
    exception as soon as the max-states is reached. This can be useful in test.
    If allow_partial is true, the algorithm will output partial results when the
    specified max_states is reached (when larger than zero), instead of throwing
    out an error.
    The function will return false if partial FST is generated, and true if the
    complete determinized FST is generated.
