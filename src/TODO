 Help needed:
  - Proofread documentation and make suggestions for 
    changes/clarification.
  - Try to run the scripts and compile on various platforms, and
    report problems.

 TODO items (Arnab):
  Check the clapack configuration in the configure script... not clear
     what the purpose of CLAPACK_ROOT is.  I think the configure script
     should create a Makefile that doesn't depend on external variables (Dan)
  Add separate min-count at root of tree for regression-tree fMLLR/MLLR
  Add fMLLR scripts for SGMM.

 TODO items (Dan):
  Remove cpplint.py from distribution.
  Remove feat/test_data/ (or Karel to get other data?).
  Remove non-Kaldi code from decoder/
  Rename to branches/kaldi-1.0
  Remove data from feat/test, and corresponding test?

  Add code to average over multiple models while aligning...

 documentation:
  add something on dir structure
  add something on doxygen

  -restore table_examples to mainpage.dox when done.
  -Include some examples of advanced usage of tables.

  [? + make sub-directories for different language-models/lexicons in scripts]

   - See if I can still do the reversed decoding if possible, and
     maybe rationalize the graph creation.

   - Implement lattice generation

Minor:

 RE reversing FSTs:  need to reverse Arpa.  
   programs to: convert Arpa->exclusive counts;
   exclusive counts-> inclusive counts; reverse inclusive counts;
   inclusive counts-> exclusive counts; exclusive counts->Arpa.


in future (maybe)
 make sure calls like fopen, strtoll, strtod (check for more) use reentrancy 
 structures.  (also rand_r, snprintf vs spritnf...?) (?)

 Make sure, when we get the SGMM stuff working, that results are fully
  reproducible (last year's code does not
  seem to have been reproducible, due I imagine to rand() issues.) 
 
 Add the stuff RE symmetric SGMMS, from the old to the new  SGMM code. [?]
