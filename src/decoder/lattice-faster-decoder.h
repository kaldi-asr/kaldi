/** This is the "normal" lattice-generating decoder.
    See \ref lattices_generation \ref decoders_faster and \ref decoders_simple
     for more information.

   The decoder is templated on the FST type and the token type.  The token type
   will normally be StdToken, but also may be BackpointerToken which is to support
   quick lookup of the current best path (see lattice-faster-online-decoder.h)

   The FST you invoke this decoder with is expected to equal
   Fst::Fst<fst::StdArc>, a.k.a. StdFst, or GrammarFst.  If you invoke it with
   FST == StdFst and it notices that the actual FST type is
   fst::VectorFst<fst::StdArc> or fst::ConstFst<fst::StdArc>, the decoder object
   will internally cast itself to one that is templated on those more specific
   types; this is an optimization for speed.
