This README has been created for those with whom we share the
"pre-release" version of Kaldi.  Although the toolkit has not
been "officially" released, I have been given the OK to share
it privately for "non-commercial purposes" (whatever that means).
The official release is scheduled for mid-March.

The current version is not as polished as we would like, and contains
some files that should eventually be deleted.  

See http://merlin.fit.vutbr.cz/kaldi/ for documentation 
(may not always be fully up to date).  This documentation
is generated by running "doxygen" from the src/ directory,
and appears in src/html/

I assume that the reader would like to (1) build the toolkit
and (2) run the example system builds.

To build the toolkit: see ./INSTALL.  These instructions are valid for UNIX
systems including various flavors of Linux; Darwin; and Cygwin (has not been
tested on more "exotic" varieties of UNIX).  For Windows installation
instructions (excluding Cygwin), see windows/INSTALL.

To run the example system builds, see egs/README.txt

If you encounter problems (and you probably will), your first point of contact
should be Dan Povey (dpovey@microsoft.com).  In addition to specific questions,
please let me know if there are specific aspects of the project that you feel
could be improved, that you find confusing, etc., and which missing features you
most wish it had.
