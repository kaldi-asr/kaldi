# Installation instructions for native Windows with Visual
# studio (for cygwin installation, see the instructions 
# in ../INSTALL).

#NOTE: These instructions are valid June 2015, MKL and OpenBLAS are supported
#NOTE: ATLAS is not supported and I personally have no intention to work on supporting
#      it, as it requires whole cygwin environment
#NOTE: While the 32bit project files will still be generated, we don't really
#      care if they work or not. They will be removed in the near future.
#NOTE: The build process were validated using MSVS2013 and partially (MKL only) using MSVS2015-rc
#NOTE: We support only openfst-1.3.x for now.
#NOTE: I suggest to have git installed -- not only because we will 
#      use it to download the source codes (you could download archives
#      instead of it), but also because the windows version comes
#      with a bunch of useful utilities. 
#NOTE: The examples will assume you have installed the git for windows
#      and during the installation you chose the GIT Shell to install as well.
#      Moreover, all the commands are issued from the same session

1) Checkout Kaldi trunk, either using the svn from the url
   https://svn.code.sf.net/p/kaldi/code/trunk
   or using git from 
   https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi.git
   Example:
     $ git clone https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi.git kaldi

2) enter the (kaldi)/tools directory in the freshly 
   checked-out kaldi repo. All following actions should
   be taken in the tools dir
   Example:
     $ cd (kaldi)/tools
	 (kaldi)/tools$ pwd
   
   
2a) Use git to clone the OpenFST(win) from
   https://github.com/jtrmal/openfstwin-1.3.4.git
   Example:
     (kaldi)/tools$ git clone https://github.com/jtrmal/openfstwin-1.3.4.git openfst
   
   
2b) Download pthread-win32 (or wget or curl)
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/pthreads4w/
     (kaldi)/tools$ wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pthreads4w/pthreads-w32-2-9-1-release.zip
	 (kaldi)/tools$ mkdir pthreads; cd pthreads
	 (kaldi)/tools/pthreads$ unzip ../pthreads-w32-2-9-1-release.zip

2c) Use patch (or you can use git patch) to patch the OpenFST(win)
   patch location tools/extras/openfstwin-1.3.4.patch,
   Example:
     (kaldi)/tools$ cd openfst
	 (kaldi)/tools/openfst$ patch -p1 <../extras/openfstwin-1.3.4.patch 

3)  Open the OpenFST solution in VS -- 
   for VS 2013, the correct solution is in VS2012 directory
   for VS 2014, the correct solution is in VS2014 directory
   !!!switch the configuration to debug|x64 and build the solution
   !!!The same for configuration release|x64
   If either of the two won't build, you should stop here and start figuring what's different!

4)  Enter the (kaldi)/windows directory
   Example:
	 (kaldi)/tools/openfst$ cd ../../windows
	 (kaldi)/windows $ pwd
	 
4a) modify the file variables.props to reflect 
    the correct paths, using your favorite text editor.
	Don't worry, it's a text file, even though you have to be 
	careful to keep the structure itself intact
	(kaldi)/windows $ vim variables.props
	
	If you plan to use MKL, you can ignore the OPENBLASDIR path
	If you plan to use OpenBLAS, you can ignore the MKLDIR path
	No matter what you plan to use, set both the OPENFST* and PTHREADW
	variables correctly
	
4b-1) For OpenBLAS support, copy the file "kaldiwin_openblas.props" to "kaldiwin.props"
4b-2) For MKL support, you don't have to do anything, it should work out of the box. 
      When you need to switch from OpenBLAS to MKL, copy the "kaldiwin_mkl.props" 
	  to "kaldiwin.props"


4c) call the script that generates the MSVC solution
	i.e.
	generate_solution.pl --vsver <default|vs2013|vs2015>
	i.e. for example
	generate_solution.pl --vsver vs2013

5)  Open the generated solution in the visual studio and switch to Debug|x64 (or Release|x64) and build
   Expect ~8 projects to fail, majority of them will fail because of missing include "portaudio.h"

------  	
NOTE: I'm leaving the information about ATLAS here, for reference (also do not forget to consult the README.ATLAS)
(B) either
   (i) compile ATLAS under cygwin [see INSTALL.atlas] and copy
  kaldiwin_atlas.props  to kaldiwin.props

(D)
If you had installed ATLAS, you next have to do this:
[assuming you are one level above this directory]
cd kaldiwin_vs10_auto/

# type the following (these commands were done from cygwin): note that these
# commands are a bit wasteful of disk; you could alternatively ensure that
# [root]/tools/ATLAS/cygwin_build/install/lib/ is always on your path when you
# run the binaries.

mkdir -p Debug Release
cp ../tools/ATLAS/cygwin_build/install/lib/lib_atlas.dll Debug
cp ../tools/ATLAS/cygwin_build/install/lib/lib_atlas.dll Release

Then build the project with Visual Studio.
